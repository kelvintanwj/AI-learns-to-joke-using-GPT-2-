I'm robbing the store,"" Joe told the 911 operator. He then emptied the cash register, walked out to his vehicle, and drove away. A short ways down the road, Joe came upon another service station. He pulled in and exited his vehicle. The owner of the service station was a capable man named Bill. Bill saw the look in Joe's eyes when Joe approached the door of the service station, and he saw the gun in his hand. Bill was ready with his own shotgun by the time Joe raised his, and Bill pumped a slug into Joe's abdomen.Bill immediately called for an ambulance and approached Joe with compassion. ""Let me help you, son.""As Bill tended to Joe's wounds as best as he could, it became clear that Joe might not survive. Bill asked him, ""Why did you do it, son? Why did you bring that damn gun into my store? I had to shoot you. What, were you going to rob me? Why?""As the light of life flickered in Joe's eyes, with his dying breath he responded, ""Damn it all. Shamu and Moby Dick put me up to it. They are waiting outside for me right now. I'm gonna go get them. Be right back, mister.""And with that, Joe died. Bill would go on to give a full account of Joe's actions and his last words to the police and to the press. Then, the following morning, the Sunday paper headline read,""The Outlaw Joe Sees Whales"""

We just lay on it and absorb what we need."" Stuff like that.  The topic turns to procreation and both delegations admit they're curious and that a demonstration would be probably be best.

441,"The french noteA guy was going on a vacation to France. He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. ""Hi, I came for the french lesson today"" our guy said. ""Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week."" ""So there is no one that know any french here?"" ""No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine"" ""Uhm ok. What does it say?"" ""I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone."" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. ""Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers"" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. ""That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!"" our guy thought, and so he did.Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. ""Let me see"" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry"

500,"Three legged chicken.....It was Spring Break and several friends arranged to spend the week in a cabin in a remote, forested region about 3 hours from school.   There was nothing noteworthy about the first two hours, but it was as if we’d entered a strange new world once we’d left the interstate highways to proceed on farm roads with odd names and/or numbers.No other cars.   These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.    Then, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.What was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.   I was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.I accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I’d never match it’s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.  I screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, ‘you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!’  I was curious, as well, so that’s precisely what I did.I cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!“Oh, yeah”, responded the old lady.   “That was one of our three legged chickens.”My buddy reacted, “three legged chickens?”She continued, “well, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr’s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that’s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!’  Jr’s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!“Sounds like a great idea!”, I said.  I continued, “So…..how do they taste?”Jr’s smile evaporated as Maw responded, “don’t know.   Can’t catch ‘em.”"

546,"Man travels to SpainA man travels to Spain and decides to watch one of the bullfighting matches for which Spain is well known. The match was intense & thrilling. Unlike anything which can be found anywhere else in the world. Afterwards there was a celebration for the Torero (Bullfighter) and the crowd slowly dispersed, with the man leaving among the last of them so that he could savor the experience. Once he'd exited the arena, he noticed large groups from the group gathering at a restaurant across the street. Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine. As the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.Curious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal. Obviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited & happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.Though he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.After a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.Confused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.The chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today."

The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. MODERN VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with ""green bias,"" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings ""It's Not Easy Being Green."" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the ""Temperatures of the 80's.""Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share."" Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act"" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. The ant loses the case. The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of ""fairness"" has dawned in America."

Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other. She looks very closely and says, ""There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look magnificent.""

Mayday, mayday!”The employee in the tower immediately put him on speaker phone. “Calm down, we acknowledge you and we’ll guide you down after a few questions. The first thing is not to panic. Remain calm!”He began his series of questions:Tower: “How do you know you are traveling at 18,000 feet??”Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 18,000 feet on the altimeter dial in front of me.”Tower: “Okay, that’s good, remain calm. How do you know you’re traveling at 180 mph?”Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 180 mph on the airspeed dial in front of me.”Tower: ""Okay, this is great so far, but it’s heavily overcast. So how do you know you’re flying upside down?""Aircraft: “The shit in my pants is running out of my shirt collar.”"

727,"A group of bureaucrats from the EU are out on a chartered luxury liner through the Pacific.A storm blows up, the cruiser starts to sink, and everyone abandons ship.

After three months, things have changed.One Italian man has killed the other Italian man in a fight over the Italian woman.The two Frenchmen and the French woman are enjoying a threesome, but complain bitterly about the multitude of foreigners on their island.The two Englishmen are waiting patiently for someone to introduce them to the English woman.The German men have a strict, weekly alternating sex schedule; the woman gets weekends off.The Dutch men are fully prepared, in general, to share the woman. However, they are still debating how to ensure that both will have an exactly equal share, how to reduce supervision cost, and how to guarantee the woman equal rights. They are writing to the Hague.The Luxemburg men are still recovering from the shock of seeing half the population of Luxembourg stranded on the island. But they will soon start collecting seashells on the beach.The Finnish men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Finnish woman, and started swimming.They were soon overtaken by the Portuguese men.The Danish trio embarked on a search for people to join them in an orgy.

752,"So Satan asks God to let him back into Heaven...God says ""Satan, you've betrayed me before, but I am a just and forgiving god. You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.""Satan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. Easter Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. 2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces ""JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!"" Satan is furious. ""How can this be?"" He asks. ""I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!""Jesus taunts Satan. ""Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.""""Your computer was shut off, too!"" Satan retorts. ""I guess neither of us win!"" God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. ""How can this be?"" Satan snarls. ""I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!"" ""Satan, my friend,"" God says, ""You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... Jesus saves."""

When our attending physician explained the situation to him, he asked, ""Has the patient been circumcised yet?"" Our doc replied that he hadn't, and the surgeon explained his plan.The NICU cut a short length of 5mm silicone tubing and placed it over the tip of our newborn's penis, then carefully stretched his little foreskin over the end of the tubing and taped it in place. After 12 hours they replaced it with 7.5mm tubing, then after 24 hours they replaced that with 10mm tubing.The next day the surgeon arrived. They wheeled our baby into surgery where he performed the circumcision and then immediately used the recovered, stretched tissue to replace the missing eyelids.Afterward, the surgeon explained to us that he's done this surgery only three times before but it was always successful, and since it used the baby's own tissue there was virtually no chance of rejection.We thanked the surgeon and asked if there were any side effects we should look out for.""Well,"" he said thoughtfully, ""he'll probably be a little cockeyed."""

[OC]A Person Centred counsellor, a Gestalt therapist and a CBT practitioner are all travelling back from a conference together in a car when they slip on some ice, the car crashes down a hill and they all die.As there’s no such thing as God, they awake at the gates of Hell. Already the smell of brimstone and black smoke assault their senses and they can’t see more than a few feet in front of them.A shape moves though the smoke towards them and as it clears they see Satan towering over them with a wild manic grin and all three men are gripped by terror.First Satan walks over the Person Centred counsellor and speaks in a booming voice “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”Being a good counsellor he immediately communicates the core conditions and replies “I really value your interest in me but I’m wondering if we should focus on you. I had the sense you’re trying to keep me at a distance and that’s okay”Satan is a little stunned by this answer and decides to have the poor man dragged away by demons to see if hot pokers can get a more sensible answer from him and he moves on to the gestalt therapist, standing over the man still sat on the ground.Once again he speaks in his booming voice “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”The gestalt counsellor seems to be deep in thought for a moment and then begins to speak “I have a strong awareness of something in my lungs and I’m not sure where that’s coming from. It may be the toxic fumes or perhaps some unfinished business being triggered from my relationship with my father… And of course there a really warm sensation in my ass and that’s really interesting because….”Satan cuts off this rambling speech and signals for the demons to drag him away too with a wave of his hand, a weary sigh and an exasperated look. Finally he moves on the CBT practitioner and stands over him and trying to look as scary as he can.Again he asks “Welcome to hell mortal. How does it feel to know you are now a slave in my kingdom for all eternity?”The CBT practitioner knows that it doesn’t matter what happens to him, it’s all about how he reacts to things. He may have died, awoken in hell and seen his two friends dragged away by demons but so long as he can maintain positive thoughts then not even these things can upset him.He looks up at the intimidating figure before him and simply replies, “Oh it’s fine. I’m not really here”"

The engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa."" Again, he politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now some what agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50!"" figuring that he will easily win the match. This catches the engineer's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless he plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The engineer doesn't say a word, reaches in to his pocket, pulls out a $5 bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the engineer's turn. He asks the lawyer: ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"" The lawyer looks at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his coworkers and friends. All to no avail. After over an hour, he wakes the engineer and hands him $50. The engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the engineer and asks, ""Well, so what IS the answer!?"" Without a word, the engineer reaches into his pocket, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep"

1166,"Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.Little did I know.I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!"

1172,"A Catholic Priest finds a job.Dave the Catholic Priest needed a part time job. His salary was still quite low and he needed to save up while on vacation. So he got in contact with Francis, the Bishop, to get help in spreading word around local businesses that Dave was a good, honest chap ready to undertake work.  In no time at all Dave got a break- fast food.   He showed up at 7 am for the first day. Jim, an old friend of Francis the Bishop, was sympathetic to Dave's cause and was happy in giving him a dozen hours a week. He was also aware of Dave's one flaw that Francis warned him about: Dave tended to daydream and become forgetful, aloof or even careless during monotonous tasks. This had led to him losing the Church keys on a few occasions. Leading Choir practice in the driving rain was not a pleasant experience. So Jim was on the lookout and intended to keep a keen eye on Dave's performance.   ""Dave mate. I haven't trained you in food safety yet. So for this week you're responsible for keeping the joint clean before, during, and after the chippy is open for service. Right. Any questions? Good man,""  So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.  Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave's mismanagement.  ""Jim, look I'm really sorry. But I'm getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don't me cleaning.""  So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.  ""Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I'm sure you'll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They've been paid for so don't worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean.""  Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant.   ""So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!""  Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.  Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.  To the sheepish priest he said, ""Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He'll give you something to do.""  Dave nodded vigorously, ""Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won't be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!""  ""Yeah. Good. Just don't burn this place down.""  6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn't see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. ""Don't fret too much"", Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. ""Phil was happy with Dave's work and didn't mention any hiccups.""  A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.    It was nearing the end of Dave's vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, ""Dave, top job. You've done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They're so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?""  ""It's nothing, really Jim!""  ""No, no! Please tell! You're one of us. Even if you're leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?""  ""It's simple, Jim,"" Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim's throat.  ""Oh?"" sweat beaded on his forehead.   ""Simple, Jim. I'm just a good friar."""

True to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr & Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house. After several weeks they were exhausted. The little one never grew, he stayed dry, small and wrinkly, the stress was becoming too much.    One day Mr Grape returned from work with a small cage, he convinced Mrs Grape they needed a nights sleep and to decide in the morning if they would return the child to the circus. They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.    Mr Grape spoke sadly ""I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us? We've given it our all but we are taking you to live with the circus. You're just not the child we planned on *raisin*."

So they just gave them a number.""A man in back shouts, ""Fifty two, as always.""Bartender says, ""See, fifty two means he's accusing the other guy of making an appeal to stone, which is a logical fallacy in which a statement is automatically dismissed as ridiculous without taking the evidence into consideration.""""Wow, that's amazing.""""Not really.  I've been listening to them for years.  Most of them don't even know what they're talking about.  I think you could just throw out random numbers and none of them would know it.""Just then an elderly gentleman sits next to him.  The guy decides to give it a try, so he looks over and asks, ""So my friend.  Twenty eight.""He replies, ""Twenty eight?  Bah!  A hundred and thirteen.""""Fifty-two.""""Fifty-two?"" The man raises his voice a little.  ""Seventy three!""Not knowing what to say next, the man just spouts off random numbers.  ""Eight nine""""Eight""""Ninety six.""""A hundred and four!""The exchange continues back and forth.  Thirty-two.  Fifty Six.  Seventy nine.  One thirty three.  The old man stops and with a huge grin, he says ""Ah ... very clever.  Very clever.  One thirty three.  But Sixteen.  You never considered sixteen. Checkmate.""The guy, still clueless about what they just argued about, looks to the bartender, holds up his finger to motion for another drink and says, ""One.""At that moment, the bar goes silent.  They all look to the man.  The elderly gentleman is furious.  Enraged.  He stands up, and with as strong a punch any octogenarian can muster, he hits the guy as hard as he can, and storms out.  Stunned, the guy recomposes himself.  The bar goes back to their conversations, and he asks the bartender, ""What the hell just happened?""""That was Saul Greenberg, and you just said he's no better than Hitler."""

1423,"The Duel (Extremely Long)During the Yongle Emperor's reign in the Ming Dynasty, there was an imperial proclamation posted on the Quintuple Pailou of Front-Gate Street in Beijing. This proclamation gripped the attention of the entire city. The people of the three front gates gathered up like a storm. Monks, Taoists, Muslims, Confuscianists, Scholars of a hundred schools, farmers, artisans, merchants, and all the other professions in the world, along with officials, eunuchs, bowmen, arrowfolk, cart-pushers, pole carriers, coal sellers, charcoal sellers, needle and thread sellers, pie and noodle sellers, pot-fixers and garlic sellers, pancake and doughnut sellers, tea and egg sellers.... all these people! They don't know what happened with the country, and why there was a proclamation, so they gathered up to get a look.At this time, from the north there came a dude, whose last name is Sun and first name is Delong and a butcher in the East Quaduple Pailou Butcher's Street, and knows how to catch and butcher pigs. He originally came from Dengzhou, Shandong, and is around 40 years old. He likes to drink. Today he just came from the butchery, and held his pig hook in his armpit, which is a white waxed pole as thick as a walnut, a meter and half in length, and two bronze hooks at the tip. If the pig runs away, he can hook it back with one pull. He held his purse in one hand and his ledger in his other armpit. He had a rope for a belt and pewter liquor bottle hanging on it. The bottle was polished so much it lit up like a lamp from the reflection of the sun. He wore a cotton cloth robe, but it's checkered pattern? Why? Because he wipes his knife on it after he cuts everything, meat, intestines, whatever. As the days gone by it went the same way as the razor sharpener in the salon.So he just had the drink of his life from the liquor bar after work, and his legs were quaking as his words slurred, ""This wine may be sorghum water, but it conquers the legs first on a man, can't see anything in front of me, like I've been possessed by a ghost!"" He saw that there's a circle of people surrounding the proclamation? ""I gotta see what this is about"", so he forced his way in. He saw the proclamation, but he's illiterate, so he asks around. He taps another dude on the shoulder, ""Yo! What's this shit?""Other guy says, ""Slow down, man, careful you don't get a side stitch. This is an imperial proclamation!""""The hell is an imperial proclamation?""""Something the Emperor posted!""""Can you read it for me?""""Sure thing! Listen here, 'Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, his rescript reads as thus: In the seventh year of Chenghua, the Ryukyu Kingdom sends their tribute. In reality, however, they sent an old Taoist to test his power against us... """"All right stop! Don't read anymore. I don't understand any of this!?""""Oh, so I did this for nothing?""""So let me ask, what's the first two phrases?""""Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, His rescript reads as thus?""""The hell is 'His rescript reads as thus?'""""If the Emperor speaks, it's 'his rescript reads as thus'""""So what would be for me speaking?""""Uh... I don't know what would be reading as thus.""""Fine, continue""This man however's already tired of it since he has to read and then explain. He figured he might as well just tell Sun what it means, ""So basically the Ryukyu's are a vassal state that sends tribute and their declaration as our servant every year, but this year they sent an old Taoist, who knows how to do 36 styles of silent debate, and can recite 70 volumes of the 'Diamond Sutra', he's coming to to test his power against us Chinese. If we beat him, then they'll continue their tribute and declaration every year. If we can't, or nobody takes up the challenge, then they the Ryukyus are now the lords, and we Great Ming are now the vassal states. The Emperor thus sends out a proclamation seeking able people, who knows how to silently debate and recite the Diamond Sutra, to take up the challenge. If they can beat that old Taoist, the Emperor will give them any amounts of money or as high of a court position as possible! But it's useless for you, you don't know how to silent debate or recite the Diamond Sutra.""He just had to go there, because this Sun Delong has a name for being a ""jack of all trades"". If you say he's not capable of something, he's going to get mad, ""Stop! How do you know I don't know how to silent debate, or how to read the Diamond Sutra?""""Oh? So you can?""""If I don't, what do I have this head for?""""Ah! Then that's great! Take the proclamation and go challenge the old Taoist!""Sun was walking up to take the proclamation when the other guy thought that he should make absolutely sure, so he asked. ""The imperial proclamation says the old Taoist knows 36 styles of silent debate, do you?""""How many styles?""""36.""""I know 72.""""Wow! Twice the styles... The old Taoist can recite 70 volumes of the Diamond Sutra.""""And the Diamond Sutra I can recite is endless!""""Then take the proclamation.""""I can't reach.""""So what's that in your hand then?""""My pig hook.""""So use it to hook the proclamation then.""""Right.""He hooked the proclamation off the post. The soldiers who were guarding the proclamation saw that a drunk had taken the proclamation, so they took out their rope and tied him up, pushing him to see the official in charge.The official in charge is the Imperial Secretary Xie. However, Sun refused to kneel and instead turned his face in disgust, ""So what's your last name?""Minister Xie was baffled, ""So he's prosecuting me instead the other way around? or what?"" He thought. ""It's 'Xie'.""""Minister Xie, do you have common sense?""""What does that mean?""""Am I supposed to take the old Taoist's challenge tied up?""""Oh? So you're the sorcerer?""Minister Xie immediately reprimands the two soldiers. ""You reprehensible idiots! How can you bring the sorcerer to me tied up!"" He personally unties Sun. There's only one seat in the office. ""Sorcerer, please sit."" Of course, it's supposed to be Minister Xie's seat, but Sun doesn't know that, so he sits right away. Not only does he sit, but he also annoyingly says, ""Oh, where would you sit then?""Minister Xie has to reply, ""Then I'll stand.""""So, Minister, where do we find this damned Taoist?""""He's living in the Golden Terrace Institute in the Legation Quarter. That being said we must first go meet his majesty.""""What's a majesty?""""The Emperor""""Oh great, long time no see for us bros."" Apparently, Sun's bros with the Emperor.""So sorcerer, do you want to ride a horse or a litter to the palace?""""Neither.""""Neither? Then what sorcery will you use?""""I want to ride an ass.""""Ride an ass? Where do we find one for you?""""No ass, no go.""Minister Xie was flabbergasted, but he personally went to the Zhangyi Gate to rent a donkey foal so Sun could ride it to the Palace. He had Sun wait in the East Court in the Palace.Minister Xie reports to the Emperor, and the Emperor was pleased. He orders an immediate audience. However, Minister Xie ponders a bit and decides that he can't let Sun see the Emperor, because Sun hasn't practiced the proper protocols in the Ministry of Rites, and he doesn't know what might come out of Sun's mouth. If Sun goes up to the Emperor and says something like ""Yo bro, long time no see"", then Minister Xie would certainly lose his head. Thus, Minister Xie immediately says, ""Your majesty, the sorcerer isn't a native of Beijing, and just came recently. He also hasn't practiced the propr protocols in the Ministry of Rites, so I fear he may offend your majesty with his improper behavior. If it were up to me, I would send him to take the challenge first, and have an audience after. If he defeats the old Taoist, then it's easier to forgive his transgressions in behavior.""Thus, the Emperor agrees and sends for the old Taoist in the Golden Terrace Institute, telling him that China has in fact found someone to accept his challenge. The old Taoist orders two 10-meter platforms be built in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and a table, incense burners, offerings, candelabrum, scroll paper, cinnabar brush, vegetables, grains, and a bowl or rainwater.""Whatever your sorcerer wants, tell him to prepare himself."" The old Taoist says, but Minister Xie ponders and just orders the same things for Sun. The orders were fulfilled quickly. The old Taoist shook his robe, and a dark whirlwind blew, lifting him onto his platform. The officials in court were shocked.The emperor sends his edict, ""Minister Xie, ask our sorcerer to take the challenge, and also ride the wind or cloud up to the platform."" Minister Xie immediately goes to the East Court to find the ""sorcerer"". He goes in and sees Xun sleeping on the floor. Minister Xie goes up and yells, ""Sorcerer! Wake up!""""Quit disturbing me!""""Who's disturbing you! Pull him up.""Sun rubs his eyes, and looks around. This is inside the palace, and it's golden all over.""Ay! Old Minister! Where the hell is this?""""In the palace.""""What am I doing here in the palace?""""What? Did you forget? You're here to take the old Taoist's challenge. He's on the platform waiting for you. The Emperor also moved his throne outside to see you two duel.""Sun was terrified, ""What?!"" He was, of course, completely drunk, and after sleeping for so long he had forgotten pretty much everything. After Minister Xie explains, he starts thinking: I've drank too much, and in my drunken stupor I took the imperial proclamation, I'm just a goddamn merchant, how the hell do I know how to duel with old Taoists? Besides, it appears that this guy is from another country, so he must have evil intentions. Now I've really done it! He immediately slaps himself in the face four times, ""I'm an idiot! an idiot!""He kneels down to Minister Xie, ""Old minister, I've had too much to drink! It was the alcohol! I'm a butcher, please find someone else to duel! I can't do this at all! If this isn't enough for you, please slap me some more, and let me go with the wind like a kite!""""Ah!?""Minister Xie's rage boiled over and he shook, his hat quaking. He's both angry and scared, ""Oh? You had too much to drink? You're right, this is way too much! Can you still feel your head on your neck? Just slap you and let you go? You can say this to me, fine, if I tell the same to the Emperor, then I've deceived him and failed the country. Deceiving him might be no big deal, but the country will be in trouble. This old Taoist is already there, what is His Majesty going to say to him? How will the country handle the shame? Neither of us will keep our heads for this. You're the drunk idiot that pulled the proclamation and tricked the official in charge, I'm the one that failed in office and allowed idiots into the palace, and deceived the Emperor and failed the country. Even if we get our deserved death, what is the Emperor to do? He will lose face, and our China will lose face. The Ryukyu will be lord and Ming will be vassal, and the Empire will be destroyed and our people enslaved!""Sun Delong hears this and also starts to panic, which brought the alcohol back into his bloodstream, so he jumps up.""Old Minister, it's fine! If neither of us will live, then it's easy to deal with. If we're to die regardless of whether I duel the old Taoist or not, then let's just duel so at least we'll die with our wounds in front. Even if we lose our head, it's just going to be a scab the size of a bowl. Maybe I'm not as good at sorcery as he is, but it's not certain he can fight as well as me! Let's go find him.""Minister Xie hears this and wonders, ""Does he know how to duel or not?"" ""Just go!"" Minister Xie, out of options, leads him to the platforms and points to the one in the east, ""See? He's already meditating up there.""Sun Delong takes a look and says, ""Then I'm going on the other one. If we go on the same one, we'd fight for that territory.""""Just go!""""How tall is it?""""Ten meters!""""Ten meters? Even if it's 30, that's no big deal, attendants!.""""What for?""""Get me a ladder.""""Ladders are a no-go, the Emperor has already ordered that you ride the wind or clouds, because the old Taoist took the wind up.""The old Taoist, in fact, did not ride the wind. It's a trick. Inside his sleeve is an iron cylinder with wolf manure, charcoal, and Mayflower gloryberry inside, lit up. When he needs it, he shakes his robes and the cylinder's cover falls off, black smoke then pours out of it from his sleeves and neckline. Wolf manure provides the constant burn, but it's the mayflower that provides the black smoke that looks like a dark whirlwind surrounding him. Thus, with that cover he simply climbs up using hooks worn on his arm and legs.Sun Delong hears about wind and cloud, so he asks, ""What kind of wind?""""Obviously, the Guiding Wind.""""All I know is passing wind.""""That won't do.""""Fuck it then, I'm not going without a ladder.""""Don't!""Sun Delong again panics and paces in circles around the platform.""Don't go there, the Emperor is there!""""I need to sneak a peek""Minister Xie was annoyed. Who peeks at the Emperor?""Who's sitting there?"" Sun asks,""The Emperor, obviously.""""So who's the eight giants next to him?""""That's the guards, The Golden Macemen.""""What's that in their hands?""""The Golden Maces""""So bring the tallest one to me. I have something to discuss with him.""Minister Xie goes and sees that it is in fact Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Bai Wenyuan.""Lord Bai, here's a friend that wants to meet you, the sorcerer Sun who's here to duel. This is Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Lord Bai Wenyuan""""Oh, Minister Bai, good tiding to you, please help me.""""What do you need?""""I need to get up there""""What's that got to do with me?""""Without you I can't get up there.""""How so?""""Think, this platform is ten meters tall, how tall are you?""""Me? His majesty only picks the tallest for his guard. I'm in fact two meters seven.""""What about the golden mace?""""Handle is four meters two, three decimeters for the mace, total four meters five.""""Ah, that's right. Four meters five plus two meters seven, that's seven meters two. It's only a bit from ten meters.""What's he calculating? Bai Wenyuan wonders.""So, just let me sit on the mace, and you catapult me up there..."" Sun says.""What? I...'ve never heard of this!""""If you don't, I'm leaving.""Minister Xie immediately runs over, ""Lord Bai, please help him and just give it a try.""Bai Wenyuan was shaking with anger. Just what the hell is this? But he complies anyway. He lets Sun climb onto the mace, and vaults. With his strength, Sun flies 14 meters into the air, way past the platform. It would seem like Sun is in trouble because of the fall, but he was actually okay. Remember he has that meter and half hook? He reached the hook out to the platform to break his fall, and slid down it once it reached. Not only was he not injured, but he actually arrived standing up.The old Taoist was meditating with his eyes closed, so he didn't see what Sun Delong was doing at all. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was Sun descending from 14 meters in the air. He was frightened, ""Wow! There are indeed talented people in China! I only rode the whirlwind, they came straight from heaven!""He then takes a look at Sun Delong and was even more frightened, ""This man has fortuitous clouds at his feet and golden light protecting his body!"" The reason is, of course, that Sun had kicked the incense pot over when he landed, and the incense ash poured out around him. As for the golden light, it's because of his oiled cotton clothes, which reflected brightly in the sunlight. Usually in battle, the side that loses their heart first loses, the old Taoist was shaking with fear. He warns himself to be careful, which only psyched himself out more. He holds out his hand and speaks.""Amita!""Even though he's short, his voice was like a bronze bell. The old Taoist has invoked his first chant, and Sun thinks to himself that he must return one.""Good stuff!""So the old Taoist says:""Amitabha!""And he hears that the old Taoist has added a syllable, so he adds a bunch.""A bunch of junk stuff!""The old Taoist was baffled. ""I don't have that much stuff!"" He thinks, ""Might as well silently debate then!"" He holds out a finger, which means:""Don't underestimate me, I have The One Buddha saluting me!"" Sun of course, doesn't know that. He says he knew how to silently debate, but it's not the same thing. It's the kind of debate he has with customers in the butchery. He sees that the old Taoist has held out a finger, and was enraged, ""What's this? He thinks he's one generation older than me? Fuck you!""He holds out two fingers. What does he mean?""You think you're my uncle? Your dad's two generations behind me!""The old Taoist thought, ""Wow! My one finger is The One Buddha saluting me, so he counters with Two Saints shielding him!"" He then raises three fingers, which means ""The Three August ones rules the Earth"". Sun Delong doesn't know, but he thinks:""This is a trick, he raises one so I give him two, he's going to give me three, but if I give him four he's giving me five, and I don't have six fingers to give back. Therefore, I'm taking the five first!""The old Taoist was amazed, ""The Three August Ones rules the Earth"" is indeed countered by ""The Five Emperors are sovereign."" He then slaps his chest, meaning ""The One Buddha in my heart."" Sun was again enraged, ""So now you think you're my father-in-law?"" He slaps his head, which means ""You think you're my father-in-law? I'm slapping you and your daughter!"" The old Taoist again saw that his ""The One Buddha in my heart"" being countered by ""Heaven is above my head"".The old Taoist had to evaluate his options - he couldn't win the silent debate, so he took the scroll paper and pulls his sword out. ""What? Is he going to slit his own throat?"" The Taoist cuts the paper into three pieces and drew a charm on each with the cinnabar brush. He lights the candelabrum and then the scroll with the candle. He starts chanting as he shakes his sword, and the scroll starts burning brighter, which he wants to use to burn Sun Delong. Sun Delong taunts him, ""Playing with fire? Aren't you a bit old for this? If you play with fire too much you'll piss your bed at night, and your mother will spank you!""The old Taoist was incensed, so he continues to spin the fire, which grew from the size of a teacup to a plate. Why didn't it burn out the scroll? It's because the old Taoist has applied a special formula with the cinnabar to keep it burning. He threw the flaming scroll at the other platform, and it flew towards Sun's face. Sun dodges to the left and lets it pass, but his hair, which Ming Dynasty people usually wear in a bun on their head, caught fire, and half of his head was burnt off. Luckily for Sun, there was a bowl of rainwater on the platform, so he took it and put the fire out. The Old Taoist sees the charm has failed, so he starts burning the second one. Sun Delong sees this and was angered, ""Oh, so you're kicking me while I'm down? You want to burn the other half so I'd have to become a monk and go beg for food with you? Fuck that! I'm attacking first!"" He takes his hook and aims it at the old Taoist.The old Taoist was still chanting with his eyes closed, which gave Sun enough time to aim. He throws the pig hook tail first towards the old Taoist ""Look at this stuff!"" If he didn't yell this he'd hit the old Taoist in the face, but since he yelled, the old Taoist opens his eyes and sees something flying towards him. ""Amita!"" He yells and dodges to the right. The pole of course missed, but the hooks behind it didn't, and cleaves two strands of flesh right off the old Taoist's cheek. ""Amitabhaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" The old Taoist screams. Sun Delong taunts again, ""Doesn't pay attention, take this stuff!"" The old Taoist examines the pig hook and doesn't know what it is, and becomes more frightened, ""Aya! I forgot he descended from heaven and has fortuitous clouds and golden light shielding him! This man is a true arhat and even has Gautama Buddha's Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook!""Sun Delong was delighted! ""Idiot! My hair can still grow back, what pot-fixer can repair your face?""This only served to frighten the old Taoist more, as he also noticed Sun's purse and wine bottle hanging on his belt. In his panic he thought they were the hundred-treasure pouch and heaven-flipping seal. As he kept frightening himself, he finally decided to use the foremost stratagem of the thirty six - retreat!""Amita! I'm going back to my country to report!""""If you leave I'm using my power!""""No, Don't! I'll report to your Emperor first!""The old Taoist leaps off the platform and runs up to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, kowtowing again and again. ""Please forgive your vassal's transgressions! Please forgive your vassal's transgressions!""Of course, the Emperor didn't understand any of it. He only heard the stuff about ""Amita"" and ""Good stuff"" and didn't get it. He then saw the old Taoist setting things on fire and then Sun Delong putting it out with water. ""Of course! Water beats fire!"" He then saw the old Taoist lighting fire again, and was annoyed, but then while he was staring at the fire, he saw that the Taoist's cheeks were then gashed. He clapped happily, ""We've won! Good! Good!"" He saw that the old Taoist has descended and knew that the old Taoist admitted defeat.""What do you have to say?""""Ah! Your majesty! Please forgive us! We admit defeat and will tribute and declare every year!""""Of course! We must know, however, what is 'Amita'?""""That's how we Taoists greet people.""""What about his 'Good stuff'?""""I don't know, what's good stuff?""""What about 'Amitabha'?""""It's also a greeting.""""What about his 'A bunch of junk stuff!'?""""He has too much stuff"" The old Taoist points to his cheek ""Look at this stuff I took!""""Then what was that finger?""""The One Buddha saluting me!"" ""What about his two?""""Two Saints shielding him!"" ""What about your three?""""'The Three August Ones rules the Earth', then your sorcerer counters with 'The Five Emperors are sovereign.' I slapped my chest meaning 'The One Buddha in my heart', and he counters with a slap on his head meaning 'Heaven is above my head'"".""So what about that fire?""""Please forgive me! I wanted to toss him off the platform.""""For a man of mercy you sure are merciless! What about your face?""""Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook.""So then he was dismissed and goes to await the Emperor's judgment.The Emperor's attendant then looks on the platform ""Wait, why is our sorcerer still up there?"" Of course, Sun Delong couldn't get down, and he's pacing on the platform wondering if he had won or not. The Emperor sees and says, ""Our sorcerer must be wounded by that demon fire, have somebody help him down."" So immediately a ladder was raised and Sun Delong gets off the platform. Minister Xie walks over and says, ""The Emperor requires your audience, just kowtow and try not to speak."" Why? He's still afraid of that possible ""Hey bro, long time no see"". Sun Delong enters the Hall of Supreme Harmony and salutes the Emperor, ""Hey!"" Are you going to bite me? The Emperor wonders, but then Sun says.""I am kowtowing to your majesty.""Of course, since he won, the Emperor was happy, ""Raise your head.""Normally, it's against protocol to raise your head and you're supposed to say, ""It's a crime to"" and the Emperor would then say, ""We pardon it"", but Sun Deleng doesn't know that and raises his head immediately to stare at the Emperor, ""What?""The Emperor laughed, ""So did you win or not?""Sun Delong is afraid of this, because he doesn't know if he won or not. He lowers his head. The Emperor asks again, ""Did you win or not?"" He turns his head and sees the old Taoist, so when the Emperor asks a third time, he answers, ""Your majesty, I can't answer that. If I say I won, then I'm boasting, but if I say I didn't win, what did I come here for? If you don't have the skills you don't get the kills.""Minister Xie is annoyed, ""What's all this small talk?""""Please don't ask me who won, you should ask him. If he says I lost then I lost, if I said I won then I won. Old Taoist! If you say I lost, then let's go back up there for round two!""The old Taoist holds his cheek and says, ""Please no! He won!""""What's the sorcerer's name?"" The Emperor asks.""My name is Sun Delong and I live in the butchery street. The Delong Butchery is mine. I've never cheated a customer and you'll always get 16 ounces to your pound!""Who asked him about that?""So after you met, what's 'Amita'?"" The Emperor asks.""Oh that's simple! I know him.""The old Taoist was surprised. He knows me? I don't know him?""This man is here to beg for money.""""Why 'Amita'?""""In my butchery, whenever someone comes to beg, if it's a monk they'll say 'Mitabha"", if it's a Taoist they'll say, ""Amita', both means 'Give me money.'""""Then what's 'Good stuff'?""""I said 'Good stuff' because I was thinking, 'How the hell is there another one when two already begged from me?""The old Taoist starts to grimace.""Then in the silent debate, what's that one finger?""Sun Delong however started thinking: Maybe the Emperor is going to punish the old Taoist, and the worst punishment is the nine familial exterminations. If I tell the Emperor about that generation stuff, then even if it's four generations apart it's still not out of the nine. I need to say something else. This is where the old Taoist is finally mentally slain:""Your majesty, we were discussing business.""""How so? He sticks one out, you stick two, he then sticks three and you stick five. He slaps his chest and you slap your head. Isn't that silent debate?""""No, your majesty, it's business""""What kind of business?""""He knows I'm a butcher, and in his temple there's going to be a feast, so he wants to buy a pig. I tell him go ahead, I even have two for you. He wants one that's at least three hundred pounds, I tell him I've got ones that's more than five hundred pounds, he asks if the heart, liver and lungs come with it, and I tell him that he can have the pig head too!""tl'dr: Chinese xiangsheng piece parallel of the Muslim Ban joke that u/GaryV83_at_Work put up."

I should kill you where you stand!""The archaeologist, whose name was Benjamin, cowered in terror as the genie fumed before him, hoping that the genie's rage might be sated without him ending up dead.""Fine,"" the genie grumbled finally after a tense silence. ""I will let you live, with one condition. You must not shave or cut the hair on your head, for when you do, I will turn you into an urn just like the one from which I came. Remember! I will not forget.""As Benjamin timidly removed his arm from his face, he saw a flash of light, and *poof* the genie was no more, and only the urn remained to remind him of the curse that had been placed upon him.Finishing up his business at the dig site, he returned home to his job in artifact restoration at a museum in the city where he lived. The genie's urn he had left in the tomb where it lay, sealing the room shut when the expedition had left.After many years had passed, Benjamin began to have difficulty dealing with his hair. A scraggly mustache and beard drooped down his chin to his chest, and his shoulder-length hair was a constant irritation whenever he looked in the mirror.Finally, after a day of itching and scratching at his face and head, he gave up. ""Surely the genie will not carry out the curse. Maybe if I just trimmed my beard a bit, he would let me alone.""The next few minutes found Benjamin in his bathroom facing the mirror, scissors in hand. Taking a deep breath, he placed the scissors close to his chin to cut off the ends of his beard. His hand began to close, and just as the first few strands of hair were severed from his body---""**FOOL!** You ignored my command, and for that, you shall *die*!"" shouted the genie, who appeared out of nowhere.Suddenly, Benjamin was no more, and all that was left was an ancient-looking urn on the ground where his feet had been planted.And that was the end of Benjamin.Now, what can we learn from this sad, sad tale?.........*A Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.*"

What if I do half and give you back the remainder?""God agreed. He finally created man and said to him, ""For 25 years, you are to eat, sleep, marry, and have fun.""Man asks, ""Only 25 years? That's not nearly enough time. Couldn't you give me the remainder of the time that the animals gave back?""God agreed.

Once they were finished, they lit a campfire. They roasted marshmallows over the fire and sang songs until it was very late into the night. Each boy went into his own tent and into his own sleeping bag. At about two o'clock in the morning, there was a rustle in the bushes. The boys and their leader all woke up. Each one got out of his sleeping bag and then out of his tent to see what was making the noise. Once outside, the Boy Scouts found a large purple spotted monster with ten arms. The boys tried to run away, but each of the purple spotted monster's arms caught one boy. The monster quickly devoured all the scouts it had caught. The Boy Scout leader watched in horror because there was nothing he could do. He ran away as quickly as he could. He ran through the forest and all the way back to the Boy Scout base. When he got there, he was completely out of breath. The other leaders looked at him and asked what was wrong.""Well, we set up camp as usual. Then, in the middle of the night, we heard a rustle.

1533,"A man isn't happy with the size of his... [long]John has a date planned with a very attractive young lady in a few weeks, and he's a bit nervous. You see, John is a fairly successful single man. He's got good looks, money, a luxurious loft apartment, and a convertible sports car. You can be sure that all of the ladies want him, but of all the things he has, there is one thing that he just wasn't happy with: the size of his penis. John decides he has enough money to get a penis enlargement. I mean, if a woman can get her barely an A mosquito bites exploded into bodacious DD tatas, then why can't he go from teenage Asian to Mandingo? So John makes an appointment to see a penis enlargement specialist. After waiting a few days he finally gets into his appointment he has been so anxious about. The surgeon asks: ""So what can I do for you today John?"" to which John replies ""Y'know doc, I'm just not too happy with the size of my penis. It's kind of... ^small."" The doctor thinks for a minute and then says: ""Well, John, unfortunately I'm fresh out of penises at the moment. We won't really be able to do anything for you until I get my next shipment in a couple months."" John seems devastated. He can't believe that he has to go on this date knowing this girl will laugh as soon as she catches a glimpse of his little Vienna sausage. He begs the doctor: ""Please! There has to be *something* you can do to help me. I'm begging you!"" The doctor responds: ""Hmm.. give me just a moment."" He walks out of the room, and returns a few minutes later. ""I have potential good news for you John, but I'm not sure if you're going to be up for it. You see, I'm fresh out of penises, but I *do* have this baby elephant trunk. I know it's a bit odd, but it will make Mandingo looks like a little school boy."" John thinks for a minute, and decides it isn't such a bad idea. ""Anything is better than what I'm packing right now."" John says.John schedules the procedure, and ends up recovering a few days before his date. The big day comes, and John is more confident than ever. He picks her up in the roadster, makes undeniably confident eye contact, and is making her laugh all the way to the restaurant. Really, everything has been going beautifully. They arrive at a *fancy* restaurant, valet parks his car, and they are seated immediately. A minute later the waiter comes with a basket of bread rolls, places them on the table, and asks what they would like to drink. John orders them both the most expensive bottle of wine they had. The waiter leaves to retrieve the wine while John and his beautiful date look over the menu. John tells her that she can have *anything* she'd like. ""Don't even look at the pricing, money isn't an issue."" he says. The waiter returns with the wine, and they place their order. While waiting for their food they decide to dig into the rolls. They both get a roll, butter it, and begin eating. Everything seems dandy, and then out of **nowhere** a baby elephant trunk **SHOOTS** up from under the table, grabs a roll, and disappears. John's date was **amazed**. ""**WOAH!** Can you do that again?!"" she said. To which he replied:""I can, but I don't think I could fit another roll up my ass."""

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""But the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.Without even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firefighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.Within a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""""Vell,"" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!"""

What was that?!""So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""Apparently, no sex tonight either!Edit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!Edit 2: Thank you for the gold!"

1697,"What is the difference between a Jew and a pizza?The pizza doesn’t scream when you throw it in the oven.This joke is good not because of any inherent humor, but rather because of its failure to amuse. It serves, therefore, as a valuable cautionary tale.The first flaw in the anecdote’s construction is in its gratuitous use of ethnicity as a crutch. To be sure, Jews serve as an invaluable comedy resource. Any joke involving miserliness of any kind can be improved by the addition of a Hebraic surname (or, in the alternative, by the addition of the prefix “Mac.”) But here, “Jewishness” does not improve the comedy one wit. Any ethnicity will scream when placed in an oven. You throw an Irishman into an oven, and see if he doesn’t cry out “Begosh and begorrah, I’ve been thrown into an oven!” So too the Mexican, whose refrain of “Ai yi yi, es mui caliente!” is equally plausible. Indeed, the only person who should ever be thrown into an oven in comedy is Sylvia Plath.Many of you may object, “But what of the Holocaust? Surely that validates the choice of ‘Jew’ in the set-up?”Far from it. One must be very careful when relying on history as validation. The Nazis threw very few screaming Jews into the oven. This is not Holocaust revisionism, it’s simply fact. The Germans are a very efficient people, and they killed almost all their victims before disposing of their bodies in factory-like furnaces. To do otherwise would slow their production lines of death down, and that would be intolerable to the German psyche. No, no. The corpses that were thrown into the ovens went in not unlike the aforementioned pizza – silently.Thus, the fundamental logic of the joke is ruined. The difference does not hold up under historical scrutiny. So when you are asked to contemplate the difference between a Jew and a pizza, plausible answer is: “One is a human being with a human soul and a human mind and inherent human dignity, and the other is a molded dough product.” Or “You take the pizza out of the oven in one piece.”"

A heavenly glow of fluorescent lamps convinced him what he was doing was right. Moments later, there it was. The bronze vault door. A steel circle, weighing around 22 tons, would be the only challenge. He was getting closer. The thoughts of money were coursing through hisA security guard noticed the theft.

As the squirrel was running away, it got to the end of the fairway when it was caught by a hawk, which flew high into the air.""Once again, he priest interrupts, ""So that's when you cursed?""The man continues, ""No Father.

As it passed over the green, it squeezed the squirrel with its talons, causing the ball to drop about three feet from the pin.""The priest says, ""Don't tell me you missed the fucking putt!"""

1941,"The Tramps HolidayThere was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""The tramp blushed.The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...I'm a just poor tramp...so you must understand...I've been through many a hard ship in my life."""

1952,"One fine evening a man was riding his motorcycle......down a rural country road. It was a gorgeous sight against the red and orange sunset. He had been riding for about an hour and passed all sorts of country sights. A tractor in a field. Cows grazing. A canopy tunnel of trees. And different novelty mailboxes including a bright pink one. . Suddenly a downpour came upon him. The sudden rain made the roads very slippery and he wound up laying the bike over in a ditch. This caused some parts to come loose and hoses break. He reached for his phone but  it was soaked and unable to turn on after the accident.Stranded and alone, he decided to walk down the road back the way he came. The pink mailbox was less than a mile away and he figured there was a house nearby. As he finally started to reach the pink mailbox, he noticed there were pink flowers planted around it. He thought nothing of it and made his way down the long now-muddy road. After a few minutes he came upon a huge pink gate with pink railings and a pink call box.The man rang the pink box and a pink tinted screen came on with an old lady answering,“Hello?”“Hello,” said the man. “I’ve been riding down the road and had an accident. Would it be alright if I came in and used your phone? My cell phone is soaked.”“Of course!” said the old woman. And the huge pink gate gave a creak as it opened up.The man walked through the huge pink gate and walked up to her house. It was a massive, 3-story, colonial style house with a porch that wrapped completely around. And it was all pink. The house had pink bushes planted in front. Pink steps with pink banisters led up to the pink porch with pink rocking chairs and pink ceiling fans. He walked up and rang the pink doorbell which gave out a very bright and pleasant “ding.” The large pink front door opened up and the old woman greeted him with a smile. She was wearing a pink nightgown and pink slippers.“Please, come in,” she said, and motioned her little hand inside.As the man stepped inside, his jaw dropped. Every single thing inside the house was pink. The tile on the floor was two-toned, checkerboard style pink. The curtains we pink with pink embroidery embellishments. Even the frames on the windows were pink. He took a step and started to take his muddy boots off when he noticed the pink umbrella holder and pink coat rack. “You are soaked to the bone! Would you like a towel to dry off?” asked the little pink woman.“Yes, please,” answered the man.“Go into the kitchen. The telephone is in there,” she instructed, as she went into another room.The man made his way across the entry room into the kitchen. His hand lightly swept across the pink dresser, along the pink walls and pink trim, down the pink door frame, and to the small pink dining table. He sat in a pink chair and picked up the pink rotary phone. Even the telephone wire was pink. He attempted to dial a number but the phone seemed to be disconnected.The little pink lady came in with a large pink towel and handed it to the man. It was warm as if it had just come out of the clothes dryer.“Thank you so much,” said the man. “But I think your phone is disconnected because of the storm.”The pink lady responded,”Oh, that’s a shame. Well, if you need to you can stay in one of the guest bedrooms for the night.”The man thanked her for her kindness and made his way up the pink stairs, holding onto the pink banister. He walked down the pink hallway with pink wallpaper. He walked into a bedroom and found it to be completely pink. On the pink bed were some pink pajamas, a pink robe, another pink towel, and a pink travel toothbrush wrapped in plastic. He took the pink towel, pink robe, and pink toothbrush and went to the bathroom to wash up before bed.In the bathroom, the man undressed and used the pink soap and pink shampoo to wash himself. Then he dried himself with the pink towel and put on the pink robe. He used the pink sink to brush his teeth with the pink toothbrush with the pink toothpaste that was already in the pink bathroom.He then went back into the pink bedroom and changed into his pink pajamas. He laid down on the bed and covered himself with the pink blanket and pink sheet. Then, laying his head down on the pink pillow, he fell right to sleep.In the morning, the man woke up and made his way downstairs. In the hallway, he ran into two other men. They introduced themselves and explained to each other why they were there. One man had slid into a ditch near the motorcycle accident and lost his phone. The other man was the pink lady’s nephew who came in earlier that morning. After making their way down, they came upon the little old lady was already dressed in a pink top and pink pants with little pink shoes. She was carrying the man’s clothes and asked the gentlemen if they would like breakfast.“Would you like bacon and eggs or oatmeal?” she asked.“I’ll have oatmeal, Auntie.”“I’ll have bacon and eggs,” said the man in the car accident.“I’ll have bacon and eggs, as well,” said the man in the motorcycle accident.“Very good,” said the little pink lady. She made the breakfast with her pink cooking utensils and pink pots and pans. The bacon sizzled and steam rose into the pink vent. She took out some pink plates and pink silverware and set them on the table where the men were seated. She brought down some pink glasses and poured each man some strawberry milk.They all ate and were satisfied with their breakfast. The man tried the phone again and it was working. He called his wife and asked her to come pick him up. The man in the car accident used the phone and asked his roommate to pick him up.A few hours later, the wife and the roommate both show up and pick up their respective husband and friend. And they all lived happily ever after.There is one conclusion we can take from this story.Two out of three men prefer bacon and eggs over oatmeal."

Sometimes when I ask her questions she can't hear me. What should I do?"" The doctor replied, ""Here's what you need to do. Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner. If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again. If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time. If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time. If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing.""So the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night.

Multiple times a day, my skin will puff up and get all red almost instantly, with no warning.""The doctor thought this was very odd, and wanted to have Mr. Pott wait with him in one of his rooms for a while to see if he could catch the odd phenomenon. They waited...And waited...THERE! No, that was just a trick of the light...Hours went by...Finally it was time for the doctor's office to close. Mr. Pott left the office, and as soon as he got into his car, his skin got all red and puffy. He called the doctor the next day, and said that it happened again as soon as he got into his car, and asked if he could come back into the office. The doctor said sure, since he wasn't busy that day.Again Mr. Pott and the doctor waited to witness the described symptoms, but again, nothing happened all day. That night, as Mr. Pott was getting into his car, he broke out in a rash almost instantly. Mr. Pott again called the doctor and asked to come in. Every day Mr. Pott would go see the doctor. This went on for days, weeks, and finally months, to no avail. In fact, the doctor never did see the odd skin condition, because a watched Pott never boils. Edit: A name"

Not wanting to leave her parrot at home, she simply stores the parrot in her shirt and acts like she is pregnant. While on the plane, the pilot is walking down the aisle smoking a cigar. He stops at the woman and asks her how her flight is going. Before she can reply, the parrot says ""it's going great"". Surprised, the pilot pulls the parrot out from under her shirt. ""You can't have a parrot on this plane!"" He says. She takes the cigar from his mouth and says ""Well you can't have a cigar on this plane!"" Enraged, the pilot throws the parrot out the window. This incites the woman to throw the cigar out the window. The pilot returns to the cockpit and is angry about losing his cigar.

2036,"The Muslim BanSeveral centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all Muslims had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti didn't speak Italian, and the Pope didn't speak Arabic, they agreed that it would be a ""silent"" debate.On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his fingers around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!""Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. ""I haven't a clue,"" the Mufti said. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it 'the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!"" ""And then what?"" asked a woman. ""Who knows?"" said the Mufti. ""He took out his lunch so I took out mine.""Edit: First time I heard this joke was around a year ago, but I had never heard the Jewish one until shortly after. So yeah, I'm well aware it's a repost, but, obviously by the votes, not that many people heard it the first time around (or second, third...fifth...twenty-second...etc.) so thank you, but it has already been pointed out."

One of them manages to convince Paul, in his drunk state, that anything is edible when combined with enough potatoes and pastry. Paul thinks that this is the most amazing thing he's ever heard, and runs home to test it. After getting home, he looks around for non-food items to eat with potatoes, and eventually settles on the idea of trying to eat a Biro.So he smashes the Biro into small pieces, combines it with a few potatoes, puts the mixture in a savoury pastry, and bakes it for a while. After it's baked, he's slightly less drunk and realises it's not such a great idea to try and eat a Biro, but he knows his friends won't let him forget it if he reneges on his commitment, so he eats it anyway. It takes him a while, and by the time he's finished he feels tired from chewing and wants to wait for the potato to digest, so he decides to try and sleep for a while.While he's half sleeping and half just lying there, Paul - predictably enough - is thinking about Biros, and has a brainwave. His company can put their logo on anything and double the price, right? So why not start selling incredibly expensive writing implements? He writes this down in a fit of genius and takes it into the office the next day. He tells his manager about the idea, who then tells their own manager, and so on and so on. Apparently, someone at the top liked the idea, because the following month, Tim Cook calls a press conference to introduce his new product.Tim walks up onto the stage holding a long, thin object. A larger picture comes up on screen - it's a Biro, but it's made of a light grey plastic and has the company logo on it. Tim announces that the stylish new design is going to be called the *iWrite*, and that it will cost $150 at launch.However, to this day, within that office, it's still referred to by everyone who knows its origin as *pen-pie-nap Paul's Apple pen*."

""You don't seem to understand the *weight* of your situation so let me attempt to break this down for you. I have been in practice for almost 15 years and you are literally the fattest man who has ever walked into this office. You aren't just fat, you are at a level of obesity that I personally didn't even think was medically possible. The fact that you were able to walk into this office on your own strength alone is a miracle that would make Jesus Christ ask *How'd he do that?* and that guy walked on water. When we did your blood work, your blood sugar level was at 500 which effectively makes you a brand of coffee sweetener. I couldn't even take your blood pressure with a normal pressure cuff because of how fat your arms are. I had to jerry-rig a cuff out of the spare tire of my Ford F150. Your cholesterol level came back as Land-O-Lakes. My goal is to try and get that to ""I can't believe it's not butter"" but even that's a long shot. Your blood was so thick and meaty that we received a call from the blood center asking us why we decided to send them a tube of Ragu to analyze. Are you following me on this or do you need me to give you some more examples?""The room goes quiet again as the severely obese man stares at the doctor with a face that is beat red from anger.

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can't tell you because you're not a monk."

""Jim Bowie, 1836.""At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.""The teacher glared and asked, ""All right! Now, who said that?""Again, Pedro.

2367,"Elephants Never ForgetFrank owned a full grown African Elephant and due to the rising costs of living, he found it was getting expensive to feed his pet. Frank thought long and hard for a solution and upon watching a circus program on T.V. thought of the perfect scam to make some quick money. You see Frank had seen elephants stand on three legs, two legs, and even one leg, but he had never seen a full grown elephant take all four feet off the ground at once. So he created a challenge and put it out in the newspapers and T.V. The challenge was for someone to get the elephant to take all four feet off the ground at once without using any device that would actually lift the elephant from the ground such as a crane, hoist, or the like, if successful they would receive a 10,000 dollar cash prize, but the catch was they had to pay 100 dollars to try.Turned out people came from far and wide, even other countries. Everyone tried everything they could from coaxing to hypnosis to threats, but try as they might everyone failed in their attempt. Frank was elated, his scheme was working brilliantly and he was making some nice dough.One day a blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.""Good afternoon sir, Is it true that if I can get your elephant to take all his feet off the ground at once I'll win 10,000 dollars?""Frank replied. ""Good afternoon to you too sir, yes it is true, but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.""The man nodded and agreed. He gave Frank the 100 dollars, walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out an old fashioned wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat and walked up and looked the elephant in the eye. A few moments later he walked around behind the elephant, took a stable stance and took a home run swing at the elephants testicles that would have made the Babe proud. The elephant trumpeted out and jumped into the air taking all four feet off the ground. Frank stood with his mouth gaping open and reluctantly handed the 10 000 dollars to the stranger. The man got into his car and drove off.A few months later Frank began to get low on funds again. Although his challenge had been won, he had still made a good profit. But now he began to try and think of another scam to make even more money, this time, find one that couldn't be accomplished.So Frank came up with a new challenge and once again put it in the newspapers and on T.V. This time he was sure of his challenge. He had seen elephants move their heads up and down but because of their anatomy they couldn't move it from left to right, only twist it left and right. Once again a 10,000 dollar prize was offered, and a 100 dollar fee to try.So once again people came from far and wide, again even from other countries. Again everything from coaxing to hypnosis to threats were employed but all those who tried failed in their attempt.One day a familiar blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.""Good afternoon sir. Is it true that if I can get your elephant to move his head from left to right, I'll win 10,000 dollars?""Frank swallowed hard and replied. ""Afternoon sir, yes it is true but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.""Once again the man nodded and agreed. He handed Frank the 100 dollars and once again walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out the same wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat, still stained with the elephants blood from the first encounter and walked up to the elephant.He paused and looked the elephant in the eye, a few moments later he asked. ""Remember me?""The elephant nodded it's head up and down ""Yes.""""Want me to do it again?""The elephant shook it's head from left to right. ""No."""

'I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back!'St. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.'Ray was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home. The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking and pecking the ground.A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?''Not bad,' replied Ray the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!''You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. 'Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?''Never,' said Ray.'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal. He did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! He was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg - his joy was overwhelming.As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard.....""Ray, wake up! You shit the bed!""Getting OLD just isn’t what they said it would be!"

2512,"The Story of Mike Doe!Hey, my name’s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.Good old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.There was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.Our year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”The standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.“Mike!

We use your skins to make our canoes. But we are a modern tribe, so we will grant you one final request.*The first explorer thinks: *I don't wanna be skinned alive!* and asks if he can have the pistol from their bags to shoot himself with. The chief nods. The tribesman rummages through the bag and pulls out the gun and the box of bullets. He takes one bullet out of the box and dumps the rest of the bullets into the river. The first explorer nods farewell to his friends, and blows his brains out. The rest of the tribe carries his body away to begin skimming it and the chief turns to the second explorer.

The tribesman fetches the mess kit and gives it to the third explorer who opens it up immediately. He takes out the spoon and throws it onto the ground. He takes out the knife, looks at it, and throws it on the ground. Finally, he's left with the fork. The third explorer looks at the chief, looks at the tribesman, looks at the tribe.

By the age of 3 he was reading full newspaper articles and chapter books most kids don't read until middle school and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was rather confused by this but decided to go get his son the ball anyways.As he was in line to check out with the ball he thought to himself, ""Nah he doesn't actually want a stupid ping pong ball"" so he went and got him an R/C car instead. The son was the happiest kid in the world and was so excited to get his new toy and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there smiling.A couple years later when the son took standardized tests in elementary school he got a perfect score on every exam and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was still confused about his sons request but agreed and left to get the son his ball.As he was about to check out with the ping pong ball he thought to himself, ""Nah my son doesn't really want this"" and went back and got him a brand new Xbox.When he got home and gave the present to his son the son was ecstatic and jumped up and down and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there with a smile on his face.Fast forward a couple years and the son is now graduating high school. Top of his class, full ride to whatever school he wanted (Yale for anyone who cares about that detail), graduated with just about every honor you could think of and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.He went up to his son and said, ""Son, I could never be more proud of you. I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.""The son sat there for a second thinking and said, ""Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball."" The dad was yet again confused by his son's odd request but agreed to get the ball.On his way to the store the dad passed by a motorcycle dealership and thought to himself, ""Nah my son really doesn't that stupid ping pong ball when he can have a brand new motorcycle."" And so the dad bought the new bike for his son and the son was the happiest son in the world and gave his dad the biggest hug he could before hopping on the bike. The dad sat there with a smile on his face as he watched his son drive off.A couple weeks later, the mom and dad are sitting at the table eating lunch when they receive a troubling phone call. As they heard the call both of their faces started to turn pale, the son was in a terrible crash and was not expected to live through the rest of the day. The two rushed down to the hospital as soon as they could and they hurried to their son's room. When they got there they were happy to see the son was still conscious. The parents rushed to either side of the bed and the dad took his son's hand and looked him in the face and said, ""Son, you have been the best child that anyone could ever ask for and I could never be more proud of you.""The son smiled and said, ""Thanks dad.""""I do have one question for you though.""The son looked up at his old man and said, ""Anything for you Dad.""""Why did you always want that pink ping pong ball?""The son smiled and said, ""Well I always wanted it bec-""Then he died."

2933,"The Tramp's HolidayThere was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""""Ahem, which holiday would you like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further...till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then...he jumped.Slowly at first,but speeding up,faster, and faster,speeding past Pluto,and the other outer planets,through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""The tramp blushed.The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...I'm a just poor tramp...so you must understand...I've been through many a hard ship in my life."""

The weatherman assured him that there was no chance of rain in the coming days.So the king went fishing with his wife, the queen.On the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area"".The king was polite and considerate, he replied: ""I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" So they did.However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see his ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain."" So the King hired the donkey on the spot.And thus began the ancient practice of hiring asses to work in government and occupy its highest and most influential positions.."

He is happy to find the bus goes express, and he gets to his apartment building in record time. He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. ""It's not what you think!"" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there's not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can't find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, ""I'll kill you!"", pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. The next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, ""Well my son, how did you die?""""Well,"" replies the husband "" I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.""""Oh boy."" Replied Saint Peter ""Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell."" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. Saint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. ""And how did you die, my son?""The guy looks perplexed. ""It was the strangest thing, sir. I was sitting at home trying to work out, but my apartment is so small I have to be creative and do pull ups outside my window. Well, I was doing this like normal, when all of a sudden a crazy guy starts throwing things at me. I lost my grip and fell, and somehow by God's grace, I didn't die! I started thanking God, but then the guy suddenly pushed out a fridge, and it landed directly on me!""Saint Peter scratches his head. ""I am sorry, son. You lived a good life, and as a reward, you get to go to heaven."" And with that, the guy is ushered to heaven. Saint Peter beckons the next person in line, who walks up. ""How did you die, my son?""The man replies, ""Well, picture this: You're hiding in a fridge..."""

Each week, he would load up his truck with cookies from the factory and make the three-day-long journey to the buyer. He would unload all the cookies and make the three-day-long drive back to the factory. He'd been working at the company for years, and was quite reputable.One day, he loaded up his trailer and hit the road. After driving for hours, he stopped at a truck stop and inspected his cargo as he normally would, just to make sure everything's okay. When he opened up the doors, there was a hole in one of the packages! He looked around the trailer and his eyes landed on a cookie, walking around the boxes! The driver couldn't believe it, but grabbed the cookie, stuffed it back in the box and taped it shut. ""That should take care of it,"" he thought. After getting a cup of coffee, he started driving again. When he stopped for the night, the driver thought that he better check and make sure that cookie wasn't out of the box again. He opened the doors again, saw the broken box and a cookie doing the Charleston! The driver thought he was going insane, but there it was; a dancing cookie. He brought out the duct tape and sealed the cookie back in the box, then went to bed.The next morning, the truck driver woke up a the crack of dawn, thinking that last night's events were only a dream. After getting a bagel and coffee from a restaurant, he started up his truck and hit the road, jamming to the radio. Once he was fully awake, he remembered the cookie and realized it wasn't a dream. Slamming on the brakes, he took the nearest off ramp from the highway, swung the trailer doors open. Lo and behold, the cookie box had a new hole in it, and the cookie was leading a one cookie conga line on top! Furious, the driver snatched the cookie up, crammed it into the box, and covered the entire box in tape. Pleased that he wouldn't have to worry about the cookie again, he kept driving until the sun went down.On the third day, after a peaceful night's sleep, the truck driver started on the last leg of the journey to the buyer. He didn't even check the trailer for the cookie, being sure that it couldn't get through the tape. When he finally arrived at his destination, the driver checked in at the office and backed his truck up to the loading dock. As the unloading staff opened the doors, a small brown object fell out of a box. They didn't notice anything until they had unloaded a few boxes; one of the boxes was covered in tape and had a hole in it! Thinking it may have been caused by mice, they called over their supervisor. After taking one look, the supervisor called the driver's company, explained what happened, hung up and spoke two small words to the driver:""You're fired.""Devastated, the driver didn't know what to do. He grabbed the offending box and stepped back into his eighteen-wheeler and sat there for a minute, in shock. Something caught his eye on the dashboard. It was the cookie, doing the moonwalk. The driver didn't make an effort to put the cookie back into the box, it didn't matter any more.He drove to the beach, took the box of cookies, and sat at the end of a pier with the cookie next to him, tap dancing. ""I hope you're happy,"" he said to the cookie. ""You got me fired from a job I worked at for years, a job I was happy doing. Now what am I supposed to do?"" The cookie didn't look at him and kept dancing. The driver became madder and madder. ""You think that's funny? How about THIS?!"" He hollered as he kicked the cookie box and cookie off the dock into the ocean.**THE** **END**Isn't that a crumby ending?"

3053,"A Man Was Tanned Everywhere Except His Penis....There was a man who really took care of his body. He lifted weights and jogged 6 miles a day. One day, he took a look in the mirror and noticed that he was tan all over except his penis. So, he decided to do something about it. He went to the beach, completely undressed and buried himself in the sand, except for his penis, which he left sticking out. Two old ladies were strolling along the beach, one using a cane. Upon seeing the penis sticking up over the sand, she began to move it around with her cane, remarking to the other lady, ""There's no justice in the world."" The other lady asked what she meant and she said: ""When I was 20, I was curious about it.When I was 30, I enjoyed it. When I was 40, I asked for it.When I was 50, I paid for it. When I was 60, I prayed for it. When I was 70, I forgot about it. Now, I am 80 and the damn things are growing wild on the beach and I'm too old to squat."""

To his surprise one morning he woke up to find that he could stand, and walk and play, his dream came true!

Just as he crossed the road his face beaming, oblivious to the oncoming traffic, a bus tried to swerve and miss him but it was to late.

3120,"Long ago, there was a cathedral...The old bell ringer had passed away and the bishop set out a sign announcing that the position was now open for new applicants.  A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, ""if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.""  Elated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.Weeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  Another replies...""No, but his face sure rings a bell!""With a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.To ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  And a voice replies...""No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!"""

The old man handed a potion to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, ""This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoon and then say '1-2-3'."" When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life and you can perform as long as you want.""  The man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, ""How do I stop the medicine from working?""  ""Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" the medicine man responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""  The man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes as she asked ""What was the 1-2-3 for?""

3317,"A prison decides to renovate its showersAn ageing prison facility is constantly beset by long queues for the shower area, which the managers decide to do something about because having all the prisoners together in one area outside of their cells might get nasty. So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.So they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.When the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.Of course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: ""What the hell did you do?

It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, ""Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??"" ""I'm sorry,"" replied the hunchback, ""but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!"" Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. ""I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory."" With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. ""Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion."" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. The Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: ""Master, Master! ... The Hills are alive with the sound of music!"

3460,"A day before his 15th birthdaythe son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, ""Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?""The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.""The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.""And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, ""If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father, ""but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have."" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humour me, dear father.""The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. ""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls."" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible."" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again."" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""The son nodded weakly.The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.""I- I-""Then he died."

3529,"MY DAD....he was the original gangster copied a million times over here goes.. his words : Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife, Toni. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!   Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.   Awesome!!!   Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.   Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?   There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong?   So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another. The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.   All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5"" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, ""no possible way!""   What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.....   I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, ""don't do it master,"" reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$$!% !@*!!!   I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs. The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, ""do it again, do it again!""   Note: If you ever feel compelled to ""mug"" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself. You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered conservative.   SON-OF-A- ... that hurt like hell!!! A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantle of the fireplace. How did they get up there??? My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novacaine, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I'm still looking for my testicles. I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return.   Still in shock..."

I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.She fainted."

3576,"The Penguin CollectorSo, there's this guy. This guy collects penguins. He doesn't collect penguin statues or toys or anything, he collects real, living penguins. Penguins of all sorts, Emperor Penguins, King Penguins, Little Penguins, African Penguins, all the penguins. Now, these penguins live all over his house. In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins. The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.""Honey,"" she said to him, ""You have got to get rid of all these penguins. We have no room to live. We can no longer afford to have nice things, not only do the penguins ruin everything we own, but we can hardly afford to feed the penguins. You have to get rid of them.""""I can't do that!"" The man replied. ""I love these penguins. They are like family to me!""""Either they go, or I go!"" She stated.After pondering this ultimatum for a while the man decides that he does, indeed, love his wife more than all his penguins put together. But what to do with all these penguins? ""Why don't you donate them to the County Zoo?"" His wife asked.""Great idea! I'll call them tomorrow.""""Honey, you better call them now. I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.""The man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.""Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?"" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone. The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. ""Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.""The receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. ""I'll connect you right away sir"" The phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.""Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?"" The man's heart sank ""Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.""""Penguins?""""Yes, penguins.""""Like, real penguins?""""Yes, real penguins.""""That's fantastic!!"" The donation coordinator exclaimed ""We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!""The man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. ""My wife says I need to get rid of them today""""Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!""It was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.""Damn it!!"" The man thought to himself. ""The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins."" It was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.""Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.""""You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?"" replied the stranger.""Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?""The stranger took the money.""Yeah, that should be enough.""So the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.After a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.""What is your problem?"" Scoffed the security guard.""Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?"" Pleaded the man.""Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.""""WHAT!?!"" The man was furious!! ""That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!""""Sorry, sir.""The man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.After, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.The man slammed on his breaks.He hopped out of his car.He approached the stranger and said,""Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!""""Oh."" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre."""

They were sitting with their packs beside a pile of parachutes sharing a taco and a vegemite sandwich when an explosion rocked the plane and it started going down. There was a mad rush as people started grabbing parachutes and jumping from the plane.“I’m sorry,” said the stewardess, “you hitchhikers will have to be last.”  This seemed fair enough, so the hitchers waited until everyone else had jumped.“Crickey, looks like we get the last two chutes mate” said the Aussie.  Just then the President came along. He was running late as he had been watching the drama unfold on Fox. “Sorry,” he said. “But I am a great great man, one of the best men. I am the brains of America. The country can’t survive without me so I will need one of the chutes.” And so saying, he strapped on a pack and leapt from the plane.“What should we do now?” the Mexican asked the Aussie. “There are two of us and only one parachute.”“Don’t worry mate, don’t worry at all,” said the Aussie. “The brains of America just took my backpack.”"

3696,"John owned the local florist shop.The shop had been in his family for five generations -- and he loved his work. He was a part of people’s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.All that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself “well, I’m sure this town can support two florists,” so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. But as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you’d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.One day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said “guys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I’m going to lose it.” The friars told him to fuck off.He went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. “My family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.” She was again told to fuck off.In a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. “Please sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.” They too were told to fuck off.Next, John’s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.Sitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he’s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family – acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn’t a good guy. John’s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared.

I wanted to surprise her, I wanted her to know that I cared about her and that I will and will always be there for her … the thing is my wife had nightmares about me being unalive and that she’d be a widow and the only person by her side at my funeral was my friend. I decided go to my best friends house, which a stones throw away from mine first, because I had the strangest gut feeling that he would be with my wife that night… Don’t get me wrong I love them both and I love the fact that they get along, but I just couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and when I went over to his … empty house, I had a moment of clarity. I was not mad, I was not angry, I was not enraged, in fact, it was all a seiner blob of thought. All  those times when he’d as us to have dinner together and I’d be the only one who’d say “no”, all those time my wife said he was a cute… At this moment, I felt … happy . I was glad , I couldn’t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.I was correct … My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so … cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said “ I missed you ... “. I kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, “ You know, I knew that you’d be with him, and I love the both of you for that”, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he’d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night. He was now **our** best friend and the good-est boy we have ever known. We were one big happy family...tl;dr: The devil is in the detail."

Jim got out the fruits he brought, and Maximilian carefully took out his lasagna while the three were engaging in small talk. ""Beautiful day, right Tim?"" said Jim, as Tim murmured a soft yes while frantically searching in his giant bag. Maximilian noticed something was wrong, and asked ""What's the matter, Tim?"" Tim said, ""I made six Cubanos this morning, I see only two."" Maximilian responded, ""Don't worry, we can manage with two and what we've got here."" Tim anxiously said, ""No you don't understand, I spent an awful lot of time learning how to make these and spent the whole night yesterday and morning today so I could get these right."" Jim: ""Tim, you've been through a lot this week, you should've taken some rest instead. Take a seat, no worries we'll share.""""Shut the fuck up,"" came the blunt response from Tim as he almost dove into his bag desperately trying to find his remaining four Cubanos. A concerned Maximilian commented, ""This guy really needs to chill, he's taking this way too seriously."" Tim snapped, and he jumped on Maximilian and brutally beat him up, before stepping on his face until he was bleeding profusely and unable to move. A shocked Jim took two steps back before charging at Tim, who tackled him and immediately threw him to the ground and delivered some hard punches to Jim's stomach before smashing a glass bottle on his head, leaving him unconscious. Just as Maximilian recovered, Tim held him to the tree and stabbed him with the broken glass bottle. Maximilian slumped as Tim watched both of them, standing in his bloodied t-shirt and panting heavily.A bystander nearby saw all of this and said to his friend: ""It looks like that guy was a few sandwiches short of a picnic."""

4057,"Last week was my 40th birthday.I really didn't feel like waking up that morning. I managed to pull myself together and go downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. My kids came trampling down the stairs to breakfast, ate their breakfast, and didn't say a word to me. So when I made it out of the house and started for work, I felt pretty dumpy and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Joanne said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. I worked in a zombie like fashion until about one o'clock, when Joanne knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your Birthday, why don't we go out for lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks, Joanne, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" We went to lunch but not where we'd normally go. Instead she took me to a quiet bistro with a private table. We had a couple of mixed drinks and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Joanne said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't have to go right back to the office, do we?"" I replied with ""I suppose not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment, it's just around the corner."" After arriving at her apartment, Joanne turned to me and said, ""Boss if you don't mind, I'm goinna to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back."" ""Ok."" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends, and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". And I just sat there... On the couch... In my birthday suit."

The other man laughs, says ""You're on!"", and they shake on it.They both come back to the deck close to an hour later. After a few minutes, sure enough, they hear the calls of a gull, followed by a faint splat. The salior looks down in disbelief at the pile of bird shit on the center of the tape. He pays up.A couple of days pass. It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. Back on the deck, another salior finds John walking around in his rain coat, and asks why he's wearing such odd attire on such a pretty day.

Ole's first assignment was in a military induction center. Because he was a good talker, they assigned him the duty of advising new recruits about government benefits, especially the GI life insurance, to which they were entitled. The officer in charge soon noticed that Ole was getting a 99% sign-up rate for the more expensive supplemental form of GI insurance. This was remarkable, because it cost these low-income recruits $30 per month for the higher coverage, compared to what the government was already providing at no charge. The officer decided he'd sit in the back of the room at the next briefing and observe Ole's sales pitch. Ole stood up before the latest group of inductees and said…""If you haf da normal GI insurans an' yoo go to Afghanistan an' get yourself killed, da governmen' pays yer beneficiary $20,000. If yoo take out da supplemental insurans, vich cost you only t'irty dollars a mont, den da governmen' got ta pay yer beneficiary $200,000!

""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies. ""There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor."" So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. The computer prints the following: 1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better."

4262,"Once upon a time, there were three kingdomsOnce upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides."

There was a massive bear that paraded the shores on both sides and this made fishing difficult for both villages that lie on opposite sides of the river. Earlier there used to be a small pack of wolves that paraded the shores and now they were forced in the villages because of the bear. This posed a problem as they started attacking the livestock. The village elders decided to meet on the high bridge that connected them together to see who can help with this situation. When the elders met on the bridge, with all the other villagers in tow, they argued for an hour and didn't reach any conclusion. Then when all hope was about to be lost, Peter jumped from the bridge in the river. Having witnessed this the bear rushed to kill him. The villagers looked at this in awe from above. Peter somehow swims on the shore and smacks the head of the prancing bear with a large stone. The bear drops dead. Having witnessed that the bear is out of the way, the wolves run down and start attacking Peter. But one by one, Peter takes them all out. Having seen all this, the villagers start to celebrate as Peter comes to meet the elders. Everyone is congratulating him on his bravery but Peter looked unfazed by all this.

4468,"A gorilla that swung too farA zoo was barely making ends meet. The head zookeeper was keeping things together, but it was a struggle. Instead of a pride of lions, they had one lone lion. Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.One day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said ""Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.""The staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.The staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.One fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.The lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. ""SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!"" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...""Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!"""

One of the students, a muggle-born child, gazed in awe at the chalk dancing across the board as it spelled out the professor's name. As they began the lesson, the muggle-born student struggled with one of the spells. He was reading it straight from his second-hand book, but his wand just wasn't responding as it should. It would spew yellow flames in all directions, repeatedly striking the bells in the tall clock in the corner or even landing in the ink wells on the desks, sizzling as the flames sputtered out. After searing his eyebrows for the 3rd time, he raised his hand for the professor to come over and help him. She looks over his shoulder, sees the writing in his book, and immediately recognizes the issue. The previous owner had spilled some tea on the pages and had attempted to re-write some of the words where the ink had faded. The result? Miss Pell's spell was misspelled, causing a mis-spell from hell for the bells and the wells."

What’s going on there?”-	“Nothing dad, just doing my homework”-	“Yeah, but what did you just say?”-	“I said, ‘the son of bitch is’, as the teacher taught us, dad”His father is livid. He won't allow cursing in his house. He calls little Matt’s teacher and has Matt repeat how he does math. The teacher laughs and tells the father “I see! When I give them an example on the board, I say ‘1 plus 1, the sum of which is 2”. The father, confused, replied “anyway, thanks for letting me know. But I am still wondering where this little son of a bitch got that type of language from.”"

4639,"A monster in londonBy the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.London of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.The first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.By the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames… no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.He, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil’s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster’s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.On August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.London in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars… warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.The battle was truly a footnote to his preparation… Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.Honorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.The beast broke the surface.No human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus’ left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.The monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster’s eye.Angered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster’s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.Once he had braced himself inside the beast’s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.When his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus’ “luck” in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus’ blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water’s rush against the beast’s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, “August 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?”Two weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.The body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.Honorus’ solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.A bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London’s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.Still, Honorus has one final contribution to this history… It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus’ injuries.After the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.One week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus’ foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.In the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus’ sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing’s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:… It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames…"
4640,the ghostly act of not respecting your equalsdisapeer
4641,"the pink gorillaHere it is, the one that started r/feghoot.So a man is on a business trip through Romania. He had missed the train and so had to take his car instead. His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.So he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.He exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.As he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.He got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.He coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.So having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.He continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.A bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.He decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.The man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.""can I help you?"" asks the butler""yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...""""follow me."" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.He follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.The butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.""what did they say?"" asked the butler.""they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...""""Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms."" says the butler cutting him off again.He follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.""geez,"" says the man, chuckling to himself, ""do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?""The butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.""we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.""The butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.In the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.""you must never touch the pink gorilla!"" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.The butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.Not sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.He eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.So he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...SHHHOOOK BAM!He froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.The door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.The gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.He frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.Just as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.He got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.Running as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.The gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,""you're it."""
4642,"A cowboy walks into a deserted saloon...And there's no tinkling waltz on the piano, no gentle buzzing about the days activities, it's empty. A mournful bartender polishes an immaculate glass and halfheartedly waves away a fat, clueless fly.The cowboy sidled into a stool and fished a coin out of his pocket. He flicked it with his thumb, and it sang in the air before ringing out on the wooden bar.""Say friend, you got a whiskey?""The coin rattles to a stop, and the bartender looks up with a patient smile.""That is,"" says the cowboy, ""if you're not too busy.""""No sir,"" says the barman. ""Never too busy."" He pops the top off a dark bottle of rye and pours a generous glass.The cowboy throws it back, licks his lips, and says, ""My, my, my. Doesn't do any good in the bottle, does it?""""I suppose it doesn't,"" says the bartender.The fly buzzes by.""Well!"" says the cowboy, clearly itching for company. ""Where in the Sam Hell is everybody?""""Oh,"" says the bartender, ""they're all at the hangin'.""""Hangin'?""Hangin'.""The cowboy motions for another belt of brown, and the bartender obliges.""Now who might they be hangin' today?""The bartender puts his rag on his shoulder, looks the cowboy straight in the eye and says, ""Sir, today they're hangin' none other than 'Brown Paper Pete'.""""Brown Paper Pete?""""The very same.""The cowboy points to the now empty glass and makes the international 'just one more' gesture.""That's an interesting name, isn't it?""""It does have an air about it, sir.""""Now why do you suppose they call him that?""""Well sir,"" says the bartender, ""they call him 'Brown Paper Pete' because he wears a brown paper hat.""""Does he now?""""He does.""""And if it rains?""""He wears it all the same.""""My goodness.""""That ain't the half of it, sir! See, he also wears himself a brown paper shirt.""""A shirt?""""And a brown paper tie. Both of which are firmly ensconced in a well-fitted brown paper frock coat. Do you want me to tell you about his pants?""""I think I have a pretty fair idea,"" says the cowboy. ""Would it be presumptive of me to assume that they are made of brown paper as well?""""They are indeed. And he has a nice pair of brown paper boots, and a fine set of brown paper socks.""""It appears,"" says the cowboy, ""that this outlaw's sobriquet is well-earned!""""Now I don't know what that specifically means, sir. But I'll wager I agree.""The cowboy sips in silence.The fly makes another round.The bartender goes back to polishing the gleaming glass.""So!"" says the cowboy.

4643,I have one advice to the people of /r/NoFapGo fuck yourself.
4644,"A man wakes up in a dingy slumwith no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""EDIT: if you liked this joke, go to r/feghoot for more like this one!EDIT 2: To people screaming repost, i gave credit to  u/insolent_swine in the comments. I just did it here, too."
4645,"The old man, the prince, and the fish.Once upon a time, there was a prince of a certain land, who wanted to be a lowly fisherman when he grew up. But try as he could, he couldn't ever catch a single fish. He had tried many methods, including nets, spears, and traps, but all to no avail.Furthermore, he was looked down upon by the rest of his family. While he should have been heir to the throne, he spent so much time trying to fish and failing that he was unsuited to the position. Furthermore, he had hardly wanted to become king anyway, and saw no real need for him to fill the position. Eventually, his family disowned him and he had to live his own life in a small hut.One day, he met an old man by the lake shore, who was hungry and begging. The prince was down to his last few coins in his purse, but he gave them to the old man anyway. Not entirely out of altruism, mind you. He simply thought the old man would be able to have more use with the money than he would, considering what a failure he was at fishing.The old man looked up at him and smiled, asking him ""I see you have a fishing net. Would you like to learn the secret to fishing?""The prince, obviously just having given away absolutely everything, had little choice but to agree. So obviously, he did.The old man told him, ""Come closer.""The prince did so.The old man whispered in his ear, ""Beyond the desert to the east is a huge ocean where the water is sweet and bubbling. Many fish swim in it, for there are plenty of nutrients in the water. You will surely get some fish there.""The prince said, ""I understand,"" and started to set off.The old man called after him, ""Wait, you'll need this!"" and gave the prince a fishing pole.""This fishing pole is enchanted. It will draw fish towards it. You'll see.""The prince scrounged up what he could for the journey. He took the last of the bread he had, some water from the lake, and left his hut abandoned.He started crossing the desert. The blistering heat beat down on him. Halfway through the desert, he noticed someone was following him. He turned towards them and asked if they had brought any water with them.""Yes, but you haven't kept up your interest payments. Pay me and I'll throw in the water as a free bonus. Otherwise, I guess you won't be needing your left hand.""True to the old man's word, the fishing rod had indeed attracted a loan-shark (though the prince didn't realize this at the time). Not wanting to be killed or tortured or whatnot, the prince quickly thought up a plan.""Yes, it's right here,"" he said, rummaging through his bag.He took out the stale bread, which had hardened to a brick, and threw it at the shark, stunning him for a moment.He turned and fled, running through the desert. His throat was parching, and every step he took against the slippery sands seemed to resist him all the way. Meanwhile, the loan-shark was calmly walking towards him.Somehow, the prince managed to outrun the loan-shark. He made it to the edge of the bubbling ocean, as the old man had predicted. There, he saw a boat with some fishing supplies in them. He climbed in and started to figure out how to use the fishing rod.True to the old man's word, the moment he cast his hook into the bubbling, fizzy waters, strange fish did indeed start biting almost immediately. He ended pulling fish after fish after hefty fish into his boat; so much so that he almost capsized. But in the end, he rowed back to shore, and thought that he should set up his home here.He built a fire, cooked one of the fish, and took a bite out of it.It was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted.Several months passed, and the prince was able to live a happy life. Many travellers who passed by enjoyed his fish and paid a high price for it. So much so, that he eventually started up a trading company specializing in the fish. Then people wanted to be employed, so he had to build houses for them too. The prince's company soon turned into a town, into a city, and he had almost supreme authority.One day, however, the aforementioned loan-shark arrived at the new palace. He was shown the way to the prince (who was basically now king but didn't realize it), and said ""Now that you're king, you can pay me all that money you owed! Remember, of course that the rate was normally 8% per month, but since you're a king, it's 8% per day!""The prince, realizing what had happened, fell to his knees and cried:""Is this the reel life? Is this just Fanta sea?Caught in sand, lied; no escape from regality"""

You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...........................But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

4854,"Eat ButterAbout a year ago I was healthy and happy but I noticed I was gaining some weight; my butt looked a bit too big in the mirror. So I mentioned to a super healthy facebook friend who is super slim and always posting sporty workout posts. Her weight loss advice was two words - ""Eat Butter.""So I've been forcing myself to eat butter every day. First casually in food, then eat little chunks of it. But the weight was still piling on and getting worse. So even though it was making me sick I forced myself to eat a few spoonfuls a day, and eventually worked it up to two sticks a day. I got diarrhea regularly and I thought maybe it was working, but the scale and mirror told me it wasn't. Around six months in something changed in my body, and I stopped getting sick. Eating butter started to feel really comforting. I thought it was good, but the fat kept coming.Then I'm crying about the weight a few days later, so I go back to the friend's post, and it actually said...""Eat better."""

4921,"Square TesticlesAn elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square. The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'"

5001,"Enrique Peña Nieto, Malala Yousafzai, and Donald Trump are walking along a beachIt's a bit of an oldie, and I think the last time I heard it, it came off as pretty racist. But I think the current political climate allows me to rehash it better. Enrique Peña Nieto, who is the Mexican President, is walking along the beach one day with the US President, Donald Trump, and prominent middle eastern human rights activist Malala Yousafzai. They happen to come across a lamp, and of course what anyone does when they discover a random lamp, they each give it a good rub and out pops an all-powerful genie. ""3 Of you have awoken me! But I have only 3 wishes to give!"" Shouts the Genie. ""I will give each of you 1 wish, choose wisely!""Enrique speaks up first, ""Oh magical Genie! I'd like Mexico to become a wealthy and strong nation! I want to be able to provide for our people and keep them safe from the Cartels! I want the economy in our country to be strong enough that families need not leave in order to find jobs. I want Mexican culture to flourish such that people are proud to be Mexican and can come home and celebrate with all of their friends and family!""*Poof* - and just like that, the Mexican Peso surges past the US Dollar, and all the Mexican immigrants in America are rushing back to Mexico to work more lucrative jobs. Even now in fact, some Americans are illegally crossing the border trying to get jobs in the new world economic superpower. Malala goes next. ""Genie, please! I wish that there was peace in the middle east! That all of Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya... All of it! I wish that everyone could come to their senses and stop fighting for power, and instead work towards bettering their own societies. Education and equality for all, men, women, and children! Allow those of any  faith, be that Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, whatever they wish to believe - allow them to live harmoniously together and bring about a peaceful revolution to world. *Poof* - and just like that, all across the middle east a sense of calm crosses the land. People set aside their differences and come to understand one another. New glorious Multi-faith temples arise that attract pilgrims and tourists, and Schools and Universities spring up all over - creating a new intellectual hub of the world. People from all over are trying to get into these prestigious schools to learn from the greatest minds, and this open and safe mix of cultures creates a near utopia like region of the globe.Last is Donald Trump. As he's checking his twitter and other online news feeds, he sees that America has fallen from great heights. All of the low-income workforce has left the country, and those with the means to leave the country have done so to move on to greener pastures. What's left is a mess of those too impoverished to leave or too proud or uneducated to see why they should.Donald Trump takes a look at all of this, then turns to the genie and says, ""Well, so long as the Mexicans and Muslims are gone, I'll just take a Pepsi."""

So he was delighted at first, but the quark collector was not ready to part with his ornaments.Our physicist first tried to appeal to Rich's generosity, by pleading him to give him the up-quark. He was however rudely refused.He then tried a different angle: he offered to hire the down quark for a short period (and an outrageous sum of money, let it be said), hoping to appeal to Rick's greed, but alas.After weeks of pleading, begging, raging and convincing, he sent one final e-mail asking for either the top quark to be given or the down to be borrowed.The next day, he received this email:'Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down...'"

Almost instantly, he returns in a huge flock of bats. His hands are covered in blood.With a cackle, he points down the road.""You see that abandoned coach down there? I slaughtered everyone in it! The driver, a nobleman and his wife, their three sons, and a guardsman! All dead in the blink of an eye!""The second, older than the first, but younger than the last, scoffs. ""Child's play. Watch this."" And disappears with the wind. Even with his heightened senses, the younger could not follow his movements.The second vampire reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished, and the gust of his speed knocked the youngest to the ground. His hands, mouth, and collar were caked with gore. He gestures towards a town in the distance. As the vampires watched, a building lit on fire, and fell onto another one. Soon, the entire town was alight, but no movement could be seen from the townsfolk at all.""A hundred people in that town! All dead! Torn to shreds!""The youngest was in awe, but the eldest of the three only chuckled amusedly.""How cute."" He says.The second looks almost indignant. ""I'd like to see you do better.""The third lets out a malevolent chuckle.""Very well.""He gets up, dusts off his cloak, and puts his spectacles down on a rock.He disappears with a **CRACK.** The other two vampires' jaws dropped at the impossible speed that the eldest flew at.Another resounding **CRACK** filled the air as the eldest vampire returned to the cave. His cloak was in tatters. His clothes were disheveled. But most prominent was the blood. His entire body was covered in blood. Never would the other vampires imagine that so much blood could cling to one person.The eldest lets out a sigh, and plops to the ground. He reaches for his glasses, and cleans them with what remains of his cloak.The younger vampires look at each other, not sure whether to break the silence.Finally, the youngest asks, ""So...?""The elder vampire looks up slowly. He murmurs,""You see that massive tree over there? The one with the widest trunk, as thick as a man is tall?""Baffled, the youngest replied, ""...Yes?""The eldest, sheepishly, continued.""Well, I didn't."""

We're just sitting on the rocks smoking some joints, meanwhile down on the sand there's girls in bikinis laying on their towels getting some sun.  We see this guy walking along the beach talking to the girls.  He's wearing a big colorful Jamaican rasta hat and has this huge ridiculous red feather in his left hand.  As he approaches each of the girls on the beach he says something to them.  The girls either shake their head no and he moves along to the next girl or they stand right up, go into the bushes with him, and then come back in a few minutes and resume sunbathing.Eventually he gets close enough that we can hear the conversation. He strolls up to a group of three girls. He says to the first girl ""Hey... me tickle your clit with me feather?"" and the girl, a little taken aback, says  ""I'm sorry what did you say?"" the guy says  ""Typical Island weather!""  and the girl just kind of smiles at him awkwardly. He walks up to the second girl and says ""Hey! Me tickle your clit with me feather?"" now this girl is just aghast and disgustedly says ""What the fuck did you just say to me?"" and the guy smiles and says ""Typical Island weather!"" The girl thinks about that for a second and says ""Oh yeah I suppose so..."" Then he walks up to the third girl and says ""Hey, me tickle your clit with me feather?"" the girl squints her eyes at him for a moment then laughs, smiles, says ""Yeah sure!""They go off into the bushes for a few minutes when they come out the girl goes and sits back down on her towel satisfied and the guy keeps walking down the beach. Then this other guy walks up to him. Big fucking Australian guy.He says ""Oi mate! I seen what just happened there... tell me your secret!"" So the guy with the feather says ""First, simply say your line on the ladies. Then, if she doesn't like it just make a comment about the weather!""The Australian guy says ""Alright alright.."" and walks over to a girl laying in the sand.He says ""Oi!

5478,"An Elephant Never ForgetsIn 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University .On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.I guess it wasn't the same elephant."

5564,"Chinese tortureA young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost"""

Shortly after they started marching, the private spotted an enemy. Reluctantly, he put the broom up to his shoulder, aimed down the handle and shouted, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Much to his surprise, the enemy fell over. A few moments later, he spotted another enemy, pointed his broom, and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” Again, the enemy fell over. This, of course energized the private so he jumped up, pointed his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang,” “bangity, bangity, bang,” ‘bangity, bangity, bang.’ Enemies fell all around him. Off in the distance, he spotted another enemy, raised his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” This time, however, the enemy didn’t fall over. As the enemy got closer, the private pointed his broom and shouted even louder, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Still, the enemy didn’t fall and, instead, just kept marching toward the private. The enemy got within feet of the private and one more time he aimed his broom and screamed, “bangity, bangity, bang.” But the enemy just kept on marching. He walked into the private, knocked him over, stepped on him and kept on walking. And as he went by, the private heard the enemy say, “tankity, tankity, tank, tankity, tankity, tank.”"

Joe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. About 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.About 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. It wasn't 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating ""Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas."" He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.The whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, ""Go to the nearest casino,"" over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, ""Cash in all your money for chips."" This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it's doing. His chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, ""Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino."" Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, ""Put all your money on Red 6."" Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, ""Loser! It landed on Black 13.""Joe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,"".....Fuck."""

He was hoping he could get a special rooster - one that would service all of his many hens.When he told this to the market vendor, the vendor replied, ""I have just the rooster for you. Henry here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!""So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. ""Henry"", he said, ""I'm counting on you to do your stuff."" And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, ""Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself."" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.The farmer walked up to Henry saying, ""Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy.""""Shhhhh,"" Henry whispered, ""The buzzard is getting closer."""

While there, he met an otter. He spoke to the otter, and complained about how hard it was to make coffee, and the otter shook his head.""You don't need a plane ride every few weeks, and you don't have to do it yourself. You can get coffee beans from the store at home."" The otter explained.The man was amazed and returned home and lived life well, a significant and difficult portion of his life made much easier. A few weeks later one of his friends spoke to him.""I can't take it anymore. I hate flying to Brazil and paying for airfare, and I hate the backbreaking work it takes to pick the coffee beans.""The man shook his head knowingly. ""No, no, no."" He said brightly, ""It doesn't have to be that hard.""""Really?""""Yeah. I know an otter way."""

The Territory Government then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine the disproportionate percentages for truck versus car kills.After 18 months of research and $2.7 million spent, the Ornithological Behaviourist determined the cause in the deaths. When crows eat road kill, they always set-up a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. His conclusion was that the lookout crow could say “Cah”, but he could not say “Truck”.Edit: Crows not Cows."

The receptionist told the man that if he asked nicely he might be permitted to stay one night in the local temple along with the monks. So the man made his way to the temple. Once there he was greeted by an old monk. ""Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?""""Of course!"" said the monk. ""We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound.""""What strange sound?"" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.""I wish I could tell you"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""Although bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. ""I'm sorry"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""""Ok, then I want to become a monk"", said the man.""Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it.""""I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound.""""Very well"", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. ""To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.""The man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Many, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. ""So?""""I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!"" the man said with triumph on his face.""I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.""""So... I get to see the source of the sound?""""Yes, you may. Follow me please.""So he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.""Behind here, is the source of the sound"", said the monk.""FINALLY!"" the man thought to himself. ""I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound.""He walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. And what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound."

6488,"Two Black Sharks in a White PoolTL;DR: A story about a Millionaire, his wives and Two Black Sharks in a White Pool.  &nbsp;  Once there was this millionaire who was looking for a suitable wife. He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day “I’m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Okay honey, anything for you”.  &nbsp;  “You can know anything about me, I’ll tell you” the man said “Just don’t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn’t stand it anymore and asked her husband “I know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What’s with the two black sharks in a white pool?”   &nbsp;  The man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  &nbsp;  Distraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. “Honey, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Of course darling, anything for you”.  &nbsp;  “You can know anything about me and I’ll be glad to tell you” the man says “Whatever you do, just don’t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. “Okay darling. You don’t have to worry.” But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. “Darling,” she said “I know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?”  &nbsp;  The man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  &nbsp;  The man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  &nbsp;  On their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. “Oh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Anything for you my love”.  &nbsp;  “You can know anything about me, nothing is secret” the man said “But do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool”. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. “My love” she said “I know you don’t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?”  &nbsp;  The man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered “Good evening officers, what can I help you with?”  &nbsp;  “Sir we have some information about you and a dead body” one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. “What’ve you been digging here?” says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  &nbsp;  In the police station they interrogate the man. “Why do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?” The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he’d accidentally killed. “I loved each one of them” says the millionaire “But even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.”  &nbsp;  Confused, the police officer interrogating the man asks “What is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.” The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  &nbsp;  To this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.  &nbsp;  Edit: a word and a requested TL;DR"

The plumber is done after about 2 hours, and gives the professor the bill. The professor realizes that the plumber gets paid much more than he does.

Asked the professor.""Yes, they are,"" replied the plumber, ""but there is one thing you must know before you apply.""""And what might that be?""""They don't like educated people very much, so if you want to get the job you will need to lie and say you only have a 6th grade education.""The professor followed his advice, and got a job as a plumber. He quit his job at the University. Everything went well for him, and he had worked as a plumber for 6 months when the company decided that all their plumbers should have at least a 7th grade education. They were enrolled in night classes.On the first day, everything went well. Being an educated person, the professor already knew all the curriculum, but he made sure to put in a wrong answer here and there so nobody would find out.On the second day, everything went smoothly as well, until the instructor asked the professor for the formula for the area of a circle. As he walked to the front of the room, his mind went totally blank. He could not remember the formula, no matter how hard he tried. He frantically wrote equations and formulas on the blackboard, trying to find the formula he needed. He found something after several minutes of frantic scribbling, but alas, it was incorrect. He felt defeated, knowing his secret would be revealed and he hadn't even gotten the question right.The plumbers quietly talked among themselves. The professor thought about what insults they might be coming up with, and what would happen to him now that they knew he was educated. They talked for a minute, before, apparently at a conclusion, one plumber stood up. The professor steeled himself for an insult, as the plumber began to speak:""Try reversing the bounds on the integral"""

She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.She fainted.”"

Today I got on a new job at an existing hospital, but couldn't find my way around...Wearing ragged overalls, and smelling of old pennies, I politely asked a nurse if she had seen the company I was here to meet. She informed me they were set up on the roof. We were both on the ground floor at the time and upon seeing the disdain in my eyes she offered to show me to the access area. She was a cute little blonde thing, and I accepted the offer. She takes me to the elevator and we ride up to the 5th floor. She's yapping about something I wasn't fully paying attention to as I'm trailing her down the corridor. I glance left and right through the oblong windows in the doors to the patients rooms. Not much to see. As we near the end of the end of hall, she turns back to face me and spots me staring straight into a patients room, my mouth ajar. ""That man is in there jerking off!"" It was fairly violent too. She informed me he had a rare condition that would result in cardiac arrest unless he rubbed one out every couple hours.  I told her to keep me away from that guy.

7190,"Yesterday I was buying 2 large bags of dog food from Walmart...I was about to check out when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had – an elephant? Since I had little else to do, on impulse, I told her that no I didn’t have a dog, and that I was starting the Purina Diet again, although I probably shouldn’t because I ended up in the hospital last time. On the bright side though, I had lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of every hole in my body and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to give it a try again. Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food had poisoned me. I told her no; I had stopped in the middle of the parking lot to lick my balls and a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack, he was laughing so hard."

They drive for 30 min before they drive up to a gate. The bartender gets out and opens the gate, gets back in and drives through, and then gets out and closes the gate. Now they are at a river. They ditch the car and get into a little paddle boat and paddle across the river. At the end is a gate. The bartender walks up opens the gate, they walk through and then he closes the gate. Now they are at a 2nd river, which is twice as large as the first river. The paddle boat across. Get to another gate and the bartender opens it, they go through, and then he closes it.

The bartender opens said gate, they walk through, he closes said gate. Finally, they have arrived at a cave. The bartender cups his hands around his mouth and yells ""Here little green man, little green man!"" All of a sudden this tiny little green man comes bee-bopping up. The guy is amazed at this phenomenon and decides he wants to touch the little green man. Just as he is reaching out the bartender pulls him back exclaiming ""You must never touch this little green man!"" The man obliges and they leave the cave. So they come up to a gate, the bartender opens it, they go through, he closes it. They hike over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Come up to a gate, opens, walks through, closes. They hike over the first mountain. Come to the gate, open it, walk through, close it. Now they paddle boat across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Come to the gate. Open, walks through, closes. They paddle boat across the first river. Open gate, walk through, close gate. Drive back to the bar. So now the guy is sitting there just thinking over and over wow I could really make some money off of this little green man. So he gets in his own car this time and drives himself to the first gate. He opens it, drives through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the 2nd river which is twice as big as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens, goes through, closes. Now he is hiking over the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. Then he hikes over the 2nd mountain that is twice as tall as the first mountain. Opens the gate, walks through, closes it. He walks up to the cave and yells ""Here little green man, little green man!"" and sure enough the little green man comes bee-bopping out. The guy thinks to himself this is awesome! He reaches down to pick the little green man up and as soon as he touches him the little green man starts going berserk! The man is startled and takes off running away from the little green man. He runs to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and starts just sprinting over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man chasing behind the entire way. So now the man runs over the first mountain. Opens the gate, runs through, closes it. Little green man still going stride for stride. So he gets in the paddle boat and furiously rows across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man swimming right along after him. So the guy paddles across the first river gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and then he jumps in his car and starts driving. The little green man all along the way is very visible in the mans rear view mirror. The man starts to panic so he drives to the airport. He runs up to the front desk and says ""give me a ticket to the furthest place possible!"" The lady at the front desk says well that would be New Zealand. So she gives him a ticket and he boards and the plane takes off. All the time the man is in the plane he can see a tiny tiny green dot on the ground. After 16 hours the plane finally lands and the man steps off. At this point the little green man comes limping up to him. He is tired, hurt, and exhausted. The man thinks OK I'm out of options I should finally give this little green man a chance to explain himself. So the man stands there while the little green man limps up to him, touches his leg and yells ""TAG YOUR'E IT!"""

7277,"University Administrators.It seems that there were two University administrators who went hunting and fishing in Alaska. They flew into Fairbanks and looked for a floatplane to fly them further into the interior, to a special lake where the hunting and fishing were said to be excellent.They could not find anyone willing to fly into the selected lake, as it was small with many snags and rocks. They finally found a pilot who would take on the job for an extra $5,000. They packed in their gear and they were off for an event of a lifetime. They got to the lake and were able to land, with some difficulty due to the snags and rocks in the lake. They arranged to be picked up in a week and the floatplane returned to Fairbanks.The next week was grand. They each caught a record size lake trout; shot a moose and an elk. When the floatplane returned they attempted to load their gear and the trout, moose and elk. The pilot would not let them pack all of their trophies, as it would cause the plane to be overloaded.The administrators indicated that they must have the trophies as they were administrators and no one would believe their stories unless they had proof of their adventures. They agreed, after giving the pilot an extra $6,000, that they would leave their gear and take out only the trophies. The pilot would return later for the gear that was being left at the lake.The pilot was still concerned about the weight in the plane and taxied to the far end of the lake and gunned the motor. They rocketed across the lake but the plane was not becoming airborne as they approached the trees. The plane came off of the water and then slammed into the trees. After a few minutes one of the administrators crawled out of the plane and made his way to a large rock on which he stood to evaluate their situation. A voice came from the plane “how far did we make it?”.The first administrator answered, “About a hundred yards further than last year.”"

7282,"Another ""guy goes to a monastery"" joke - an oldie but a goodieThis is an old one, so apologies if its been here before (I haven't seen it yet, but I don't check /r/jokes every day). I'm a bit bored at the moment, so I've embellished it a bit! enjoy :)So, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he's hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn't see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.The guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. ""Come in, weary traveller"", he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.""Please join us for dinner,"" the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. ""it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion"".""Thank you so much"" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.At the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery's inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.All of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn't want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.All of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, ""24!"". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.Another monk then stands up and says, ""37"". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.A third monk, ""65!"". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!The traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted ""17!"". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!The Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller's face. ""My son"", he said. ""We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don't you try it?""The traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out ""45"". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of 'our guest is joining our traditions"" and that sort of thing.The traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, ""I'll have another go!""So he stands up and shouts out ""112!!"".There was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.The traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, ""They liked that one, did they?""""Oh yes,"" said the Abbot, ""That was a good one - they haven't heard that one before!"""

You'll be able to see it from there.""So the Baptist walks over to the cliff, looks downward, and says, ""Hey John, are you sure this is hell? This doesn't look so bad. There's green grass everywhere!""St. John, taken aback, sprints to the cliff, looks at hell, and says,""You've gotta be kidding me! Those damn Mormons are irrigating again!"""

7403,"Monk...A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk."

""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""""Ah"", says Satan.

The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack.""    Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.    Attention female readers : This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.    Male readers: Please scroll down.                                      The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife.    Moral of the story: Women think they're really smart.    Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show.

Then it was off to a movie: the latestHollywood blockbuster, hot dogs, popcorn, Pepsi Cola and M & M's. What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed into bed.

7734,"[Long] [Religion] In a kingdom of the past, a long way away...... there was a village that lived on the edges of the kingdom, by a mountainside. The village was intially called ""Trifville"", as a play on how worthless it was to haggle in the village market - over time, people began affectionately calling the village ""Triddville"", and the villagers, ""Tridds"".The town itself was very religious; there were four sectors of the village - the Christian sector, which followed the teachings of the town priest; the Islamic sector, which followed the teachings of the town imam; and the Jewish sector, which followed the teachings of the town rabbi. The former two were born in the village, and the lattermost was initially a traveler from another village who chose to stay.One day, a giant appeared at the top of the mountain by the town, bellowing and shaking the ground with each breath. Naturally, the people panicked - until each of the religious figures claimed that the monster was a punishment from the heavens for having a poor market. The villagers were then torn amongst themselves; there was much rioting and pillaging between the three sectors, until a small boy, furious with the riots, screamed at the top of his lungs, ""IF THOSE BASTARDS ALL THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE IS, LET THEM FIX IT!""There was silence.There was more silence.There was prolonged silence.A slow chant rose from the villagers, ""GIANT - THEY SLAY"". It got faster. It got more energetic.It got wild.Eventually, the villagers raided the homes of the priest, imam, and rabbi (which were previously untouched), and threatened them to stoning if they had not solved the giant problem.While they had been reluctant at first, when the villagers had kidnapped all of their daughters as hostages, the priest, imam, and rabbi seemed overly enthusiastic to solve the problem immediately.  First, the priest made the trek up the large mountain. Being the middle-aged man he was, he took a week to climb the sizable spike. When he encountered the giant, he said, ""Brother Giant, can you not spare the villagers of your incessant breathing and stomping. My young girl wakes up every night, scared, because of your actions.""The giant, without a word, kicks the priest in the testicles so hard that the priest loses his balance, and falls backward down the mountain. He is dead before he touches the base of the mountain.Second, the imam made the hike up the large mountain. Being the somewhat seniorly man he was, he took a two weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, in Arabic, ""Brother Giant, shall you spare the villagers of your ever frequent breathing and stomping. My dearest children wake up every night, scared, because of your actions.""The giant, with a puzzled look, kicks the imam in the balls so hard that the imam loses his balance, and somersaults backward down the mountain. He is dead before he can scream.Lastly, the rabbi made the journey to the top of Mount Giant. At the base of the mountain, he saw the rotting bodies of the priest and the imam; their abdomens were noticably caved in. The rabbi, slightly unnerved, just muttered to himself, *""...just a test... it's just a test...""* Being the elderly man he was, he took a three weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, ""Brother Giant, could you please leave us?""Suprisingly enough, the Giant said, ""Okee dokee,"" and, from then on, the village was not disturbed from the Giant any longer. The rabbi, overwhelmed by his sucess, blurted out, ""My brothers - the priest and the imam, I've seen them at the base of this mountain, with their abdomens caved inwards. Why haven't I recieved the same fate?""The Giant, smiles and says, ""Silly rabbi! Kicks are for Tridds!""-------------------------------------------------------------------*Note: I'm supportive of all religions. This is just a really long joke with a ton of unnessisary filler.*"

7784,"The Cheerio JokeOn a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.A Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,“Won’t this line move any faster?”The Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn’t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line’s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,“I don’t usually shop here…”Her pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe’s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop—even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.During those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! That morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe’s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. A few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. Just as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.“Sorry, miss.”She sighed.“No, I’m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.”“I’m Joe.”His voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.“Vanessa.”Joe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa’s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn’t leave his mind for three more years.In those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe’s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!That morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO’s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. One day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.Later that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite “yes” without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. Vanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed “yes!”Over the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.One day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn’t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife’s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. He boarded a plane destined for Hawai’i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai’i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn’t sure what to do.One morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.The next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: “We’re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.”The couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again. Joe felt like a new breakfast cereal. Smells coming from the buffet were so enticing that they had to try a little of everything. They stood in line and chatted up some of the other vacationers who were there for the food and drink. Soon, all the salty food had rendered them both very thirsty. When Joe offered to go find the line for the juice they had seen advertised, he stood between the islands of food and looked around. He didn’t see any juice. There was no punch line."

7802,"[Long] A story of how two wooden planks became best friendsOnce upon a time, there were 2 wooden planks. The first one was named Chad, the second was named Carter. Chad hated Carter, and Carter hated Chad even more! One day, Chad was in a bar, drinking a tequila. Carter, drunk, came over to Chad and punched him as hard as a wooden plank could. Chad got angry and retaliated, kicking Carter in the face. They got into a bloody and violent bar fight. They both got arrested. They were sentenced to 8 months in jail, and a hefty fine for damages done to the bar. While in jail, Carter and Chad found that they had many similarities, and soon became best friends in jail. When they got out, they decided to start a business together. 3 years later, Chad and Carter's Hardware store was very successful and they were making tons of money. But, one day, they realized that one of their suppliers had stopped shipping them products! And this wasn't even the first time that they have done this! The 2 wooden planks got very angry, and decided to go give the owner of the factory a piece of their mind. They went over to the factory, which was called, ""Plank and Nail Industries."" Chad thought that this name was a bit creepy. They entered the factory, and saw a quite normal looking lobby, with a quite normal looking wooden plank at the counter. ""Hey"", Chad said. ""We would like to speak with your piece of trash manager."" The clerk gave them a weird look, but picked up his phone nonetheless and called him. ""Please wait 5 minutes while he comes down,"" he said. So they waited. The owner didn't come. ""Where is he?"" Carter said. ""He is a very busy man,"" the clerk replied. They waited half an hour. Then 2 hours. Eventually even the clerk seemed very confused. 4 hours later, an angry Chad shouted, ""Where is he!?"" The clerk replied ""I am really not sure. Please just wait a few more minutes."" Chad sighed, and then looked to Carter. ""How are you feeling?"" Carter smacked his lips and said,""I'm board"""

They left Vermont with little to their name, only the clothes on their backs and a song in their heart. As they traveled, they would sing for their meals. In these days there weren’t what we would consider restaurants, but instead people would gather at the local public house.  Since our missionaries were, well, religious, their peak performances would occur Sunday mornings, when they were thinking the most about the glory of God. As they moved forward in their travels, word preceded them from town to town, so it came to be that when they would get to a new town, they would be inundated with requests for this hymn or that. In many towns, the people had little to give the performers, and the chorus would simply request an apple for each of the singers. In this way, our little religious singing group came to be known as the Morning Tavern Apple Choir."

""Welcome to the church!"" The pastor replies again. ""And you?"" He gestures to the final couple.

8219,"DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMENNames===========If Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice go out for lunch, they will call each other Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice.If Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bruno, Scrappy, Peanut-Head and Godzilla.Eating Out===========When the bill arrives, Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff will each throw in $20, even though the total is only $34.25. None of them will have any smaller bills and none will admit they want change back.When Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Money===========A man will pay $10 for a $5 item he needs.A woman will pay $5 for a $10 item that she doesn’t need, because it’s on sale.Bathrooms===========A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, razor, shaving cream, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Motel 6.The average number of items in a woman’s bathroom is 284. The average man would not be able to identify most of them.Arguments===========Women always have the last word in an argument.Anything a man adds after that is the beginning of a new argument.Cats===========Women love cats.Men may say they love cats, but when women are not looking, will men kick cats.The Future===========A woman worries about the future — until she gets a husband.A man never worries about the future — until he gets a wife.Success===========A successful man is one who makes more money than can be spent by his wife.A successful woman is one who can find that a man.Marriage===========A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn’t.A man marries a woman expecting that she won’t change, and she does.Dressing Up===========A woman will dress up when she goes shopping, empties the garbage, answers the phone, waters the plants, gets the mail and reads a book.A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Natural===========Men wake up looking as good as when they went to bed.Women will somehow deteriorate during the night.Children===========A woman knows all about her children. She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Maturity===========Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Handwriting===========To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their “i’s” with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their “p’s” and “g’s”. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she’s dumping you, she’ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.Groceries===========A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett’s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 12-items-or-less lane.Going Out===========When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings and finishes putting on her makeup.Low Blows===========Let’s say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says, “Oh, gee. That must have hurt.” The man groans and doubles over, and actually FEELS the pain.Laundry===========Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat.The Wedding===========When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about “the ceremony”. Men talk about “the bachelor party”."

Clinton. We originally wanted to put her on Mt. Rushmore until we discovered there was not enough room for her two faces.We then decided to erect a statue of Hillary in the Washington, D.C. Hall of Fame. We were in a quandary as to where the statue should be placed. It was not proper to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a lie, or beside Barack Hussein Obama, who never told the truth, since Hillary could never tell the difference.We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest Democrat of them all. He left not knowing where he was going, and when he got there he did not know where he was. He returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on someone else's money. Thank you, Hillary R.

8472,"ATTACK DOGA man wanted a big, veracious dog to protect his business, so he visited a kennel that specialized in attack dogs. The man explained to the kennel owner that he wanted the biggest, meanest, most vicious dog in the kennel, and the owner offered to take the man on a tour of the premises. After they had been walking for a few minutes, they came upon a large dog. He was snarling loudly and biting and clawing at the cage.""He looks like he'd be a pretty good attack dog,"" said the buyer.""Well, he's not bad,"" replied the owner, ""but I have something better in mind for you.""They continued walking around the premises, and after a while they found an even larger, meaner dog than the first. He snarled at the two men and tried to bite them through the wire on his cage.""Ah,"" said the buyer, ""This must be the dog you were referring to earlier.""""Well, no."" said the owner. ""I have something better in mind for you.""The men continued their tour. Eventually, they came upon a fairly large dog that was lying quietly on his side, licking his butt. He did not seem to notice as the men approached.""This is the dog I had in mind for you,"" said the owner. The buyer was flabbergasted. ""You're joking!"" he exclaimed.""This dog seems quite tame; he doesn't act at all like an attack dog at all. Hell, he's just lying there, licking his butt!""""I know, I know,"" said the owner. ""But you see, he just ate a lawyer, and he's trying to get the taste out of his mouth."""
8473,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery...He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

It was absolutely wonderful. it produced lots of milk every day and everyone was happy.They bought a bull to mate with the cow to get more cows, so they’d never have to worry about their milk supply again. They put the bull in the pasture with the cow but whenever the bull tried to mount the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull, and he was never able to do the deed. The people were very upset and decided to go to the local veterinarian, Dr. Santucchi, who was very wise, tell him what was happening and ask his advice.“Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. If he attempts it from the one side, she walks away to the other side.”The veterinarian rubbed his chin thoughtfully and pondered this before asking, “Did you by chance, buy this cow in Sicily?”The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned that they had brought the cow over from Sicily. “You are truly a wise veterinarian,” they said. “How did you know we got the cow from Sicily?”The Vet replied with a distant look in his eyes, “My wife is from Sicily.”"

8700,"The 5 yr old girl and the construction crew.A young family moved into a house, next to a vacant lot. One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.The young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough,” more or less, adopted her as a project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.The little girl proudly replied,  “I worked last week with a real work crew building the new house next door to us.”“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week too?”The little girl replied, “I will if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the f**king sheet rock…”"

8729,"A Snake in the SandSo, there's a man crawling through the desert. He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here. He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last. He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right. He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst. He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark. By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs. As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights. Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars. He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car. He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day. He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid. Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do. Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking. As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke. He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out. He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that. He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements. After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going. After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town. He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out. He walks through the sand. After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad. But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune. Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees. While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts. He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough. Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look. He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling. He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it. So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance. He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling. Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area. His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface. Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone. He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling. It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?"" He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time. Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle. And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him. He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot. Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes. Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all. He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting. He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out. He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now. He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?"" He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?"" He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help. ""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?"" Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up."" A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him. He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake. ""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all! ""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?"" ""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."" ""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"" ""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here."" The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst. ""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it."" ""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little. ""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs. ""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously. ""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake. ""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson. ""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?"" ""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed. ""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin. ""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you."" ""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?"" ""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious. ""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?"" ""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?"" ""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack. ""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence. Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"" Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back. ""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"" ""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him. ""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me."" ""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?"" ""Right,"" nodded Nate. ""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully. ""That takes two requests, Jack."" ""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"" ""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it."" ""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?"" ""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders. ""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?"" ""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically. Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy. ""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?"" Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food? Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate... Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans... Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that."" ""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now."" ""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?"" ""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second."" ""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,"" answered Jack. ""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?"" ""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food."" ""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"" answered Nate. ""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up. ""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours. ""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to. ""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk."" ""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food. Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."" Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically. ""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose. Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving. Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh! Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to."" ""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack."" Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"" ""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."" ""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?"" ""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least."" ""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack. ""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals."" ""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?"" asked Jack. ""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since. ""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?"" ""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way. ""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Why not?"" asked Jack. ""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate. ""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot."" ""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate. ""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?"" ""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned. Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?"" ""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?"" Nate continued to grin. ""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?"" ""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't think to ask back when I started here."" ""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack. ""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate. Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do you want to, Jack?"" ""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too."" ""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?"" ""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more. Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"" ""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate. ""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"" ""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know."" ""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"" protested Jack. Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to try your best, Jack."" Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail. Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.""**(CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)**"

8755,"A compass, a cough drop, and a match.As a Boy Scout, we would camp a lot and go on hikes.One night, we had to do a night hike, alone, for a merit badge. I had left the campsite about an hour earlier and a terrible storm rolled in. The sky opened up and the ground was quickly saturated. I tried to continue my hike for another few minutes, but it got cold and I was chilled and soaked to the bone, so I decided to try to head back to camp.Lightning was starting to crackle above me, so I thought I should try to take a shortcut to make my hike back quicker. I pulled out my compass and found my direction, but the rain made it impossible to see more than five feet in front of me.I was looking down at my compass, not paying any attention to where I was going, and suddenly felt weightless. The feeling didn't last long as I thumped down on slippery earth a second later.I had fallen onto a ledge on the side of a rather steep cliff, the bottom of which was at least fifty feet down.I sat there, contemplating on how to get back up this cliff as water rolled over the edge ten feet above me. There was nothing to grab onto to pull myself up. I was stuck there.After a few minutes, I noticed the little ledge I was standing on was slowly getting smaller. The water was coming down so hard it was eroding the tiny bit of safety I had.I dug through my pockets, thinking maybe I had something, anything, to help me out of my precarious situation. All I had was my compass, a cough drop, and a match. I was screwed.So, I sat there, watching the edge of the ledge I was on get closer and closer to my feet, when suddenly I felt something pushing on my back.I turned slightly and saw a wooden box sticking out of the cliff behind me. It was working its way out of the side, the rain surely helping it along. I tried to move away from it, but the ledge wasn't very wide and the box kept coming out, pushing me farther to the weak and failing edge.As more of the box came out, to my horror, I realized it was a coffin! I had no idea how old it was, but it looked rather rotten. All I could think of was being pushed off this ledge, and the rotten coffin breaking and dropping a skeleton onto my broken and battered body at the bottom.The coffin crept closer, my foot began to slip. I grabbed onto a root that was sticking out of the cliff side and dug in my pocket once more.I hurriedly tore the wrapper off the cough drop and stuck it in my mouth.It stopped the coffin."

Across the road she sees two men from the local council office slowly making their way up the grassy embankment at the side of the road.The man in front starts to dig a hole in the embankment and after some time moves forward and begins digging another hole. The second man then proceeds to immediately fill in the hole which the first man had only just finished digging. Perplexed by the odd behaviour of the men, the old woman continues to watch them to see if they will do the same with the next hole.Surely enough, the men from the council continue this pattern for a good 30 minutes before the old woman, agitated with confusion and curiosity; decides it's time to find out what the men are doing.""Excuse me young man, what on earth is the point of this, what are you doing?"" Says the old woman, ""The point?"" Says the first man, ""The point is to improve the appearance of the roads in this area, to give them a more natural look"". ""Natural?"" Exclaims the woman, ""How exactly does this make the road look more natural? All you're doing is digging holes and then filling them in again!"", the two men exchange a disheartened glance before the second man yells ""Well it normally looks better, but the fella who plants the trees is off today!"""

8779,"Why did the chicken cross the road?To get to the other side is the most common answer, however this answer leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, ""A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact."" Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, ""All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke."" The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, ""It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis."" (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book ""6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor's influence on Human Civilization."")As for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a ""real"" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.Of course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.Even deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps ""the other side"" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener's ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if ""the other side"" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?Please review my sources for their veracity. Let me know of any discrepancies so I can further treat the topic with more accuracy."

Then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He spins around and there's the bear! The bear says, ""Look, buddy, I don't really appreciate being shot at. But I can see that you're new at this whole hunting thing so I'm going to give you a choice. You can let me maul you... Or you can let me fuck you in the ass.""  The guy thinks it over and decides he can always come back and kill the bear tomorrow, so he agrees to option 2. The bear does his thing and the guy goes home. The next morning, the guy wakes up, sore as hell and pissed off. He limps to the pawn shop and buys himself a hunting rifle. He heads back out into the woods and soon finds himself at the same clearing. Sure enough, there's the bear on the other side. Again, he shoots every bullet he has and then runs over to make sure he got the bear this time. But once again, he feels a tap on his shoulder and behind him is the bear, looking pretty pissed off himself. ""Ok asshole, same deal,"" says the bear. Figuring he'll get the bear tomorrow for sure, the guy agrees to be ass-raped again. So the bear does his thing, and the guy goes home. The next day, the guy is fucking determined. He hobbles back to the pawn shop and buys a whole case of grenades. He heads back to the woods and just starts tossing them everywhere. After the smoke clears, he goes back to where the clearing used to be, hoping to find some charred fur or bear chunks to prove he's killed the bear this time.  But he feels a tap on his shoulder *again* and the bear says, ""son, you aren't in this for the hunting, are you?"""

The bartender is now amazed and a small crowd is beginning to form. The bartender goes in the back room and takes out the 75 year old bottle of scotch. He pours the glass in the backroom so there's no chance this man can see the label. He hands the guy the drink and once again: he takes it, sniffs it, and drinks it. The man then correctly proclaims, ""that's a 75 year old bottle of scotch!"". Now the bar is in a slight uproar and the man has a big grin on his face. A man from the crowd goes, ""Hear try this one!"". The man takes it and drinks it right away and exclaims, ""ugh this tastes like piss!"". The man from the crowd responds, ""Good! Now how old am I?"""

I don't mean to be rude there, but...""*The man smiles. *""No, not at all. I get this all the time...*...Well, it started with the Gulf War. I was a young kid fresh out of high school, but I was poor. I needed money for college, and the Army looked like a good way out of the ghetto. But then they shipped me over to Kuwait. My platoon took some heavy fire during Desert Storm, and I was separated from them.I wandered the desert for days, with only the contents of my pack to sustain me. Sand. Sand was all I could think about. Everything else ceased to exist out there. I can only progress slowly, because I have to hide in my tent every time when even the smallest sandstorm comes around. I kept thinking, may be there are not just oases, nomads, and pompous cities in this desert. Supposedly there are ancient ruins as well. But until now now I only found lonely pillars scattered around the desert. Still my hopes were not disappointed, for now. I found a group of nomads, who were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. I decided to spend some time with them, before I set out again. Things went well, but I had nightmares on most nights. All the wandering in the desert must have exhausted me so much. I dreamt of large desert scorpion made of sand, some times it would be a large eagle chasing me into a big labyrinth.During one such sleepless night, I saw a mysterious man. Exhausted and wounded, was seeking refuge in our camp. Just before dying, he told me about a river whose waters bestow immortality on whoever drinks from it. The river is next to a place called the City of the Immortals. Determined to find it, I thanked my nomad friends and set out to find this City. The days were uneventful, but the nights began to terrify me. I know that the majority of deserts are rife with life. But it is frightening to hear the sand move in the silence of night. And sometimes I found footprints in the morning near my tent, and they were definitively human. Maybe someone is just following, maybe one of the kids of one of my nomadic friends. But they grew in number the closer I got to the city, and they are always fresh. And I also suddenly heard quiet whispering one night, only heard when I almost fell asleep. I woke up from the nightmare to find myself tied up in a small recess on the side of a mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. I don't know how I got there, but I managed to free myself and I could see the City of the Immortals in the distance. I assumed I can walk towards it, but one Troglodyte was already following me. I had to run as fast as I could to get away from him. At last I reached the City of the Immortals.The City of the Immortals is an immense labyrinth with dead-end passages, inverted stairways, and many chaotic architectural structures. I was Horrified and repulsed by the city, but decided to get inside, because the Troglodyte was chasing me. I eventually escaped the city only to find the Troglodyte waiting on the other side. I was exhausted. I didn't want to run anymore. I surrendered myself to him. To his will. But it turned out that he really was a Genie, and that the Troglodytes are the Immortals, having destroyed the original City of the Immortals and replaced it with the labyrinthine.'I am the Genie of the labyrinth' said the entity. 'For finding your way out of the labyrinth, I shall grant you three wishes. What is your first wish?'I was incredulous, of course. I deduced I must be hallucinating after all this running and exhaustion, and that this was desert madness. I decided to test the mirage. 'Alright,' I tasked it, 'I wish for a wallet with a million dollars in it, that I can never lose, and whenever I take any money out of it the sum is immediately replenished.''Your wish is granted!' said the Genie. I felt a bulge in one of my uniform pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a new wallet, stuffed to bursting with crisp, new bills. I counted them -- sure enough, it was a million dollars. I ripped up the bills, cast them to the winds, and threw the wallet as hard as I could. The moment it was beyond my sight, it teleported instantaneously back to my pocket, refilled with another million dollars.'What is you second wish?'I pondered the notion for a long moment, assessing my needs. 'Genie,' I said, 'for my second wish, I want to be transported to a cool, abandoned palace, into a harem room with a hundred beautiful young virgins who will all fall madly in love with me at first sight, before a buffet table set with a feast fit for a Persian king.''Your wish is granted!' Poof! I found myself in a royal harem, escaped from the heat of the desert. All around me, nubile girls eyed me with keen interest. In front of me, every conceivable type of meat was roasted to perfect tenderness, set with all the appetizers, side-dishes, salads, soups, and desserts of the four corners of the globe.I dined until I was near-bloated, and then I had a lot of sex. I mean a lot. Several hours later, laying upon a bed of feathers, brown and blonde and red haired beauties nuzzling into me like puppies at their mother's underbelly, the Genie stood before me, looking down in satisfaction at his work so far.'What is your third wish?'I thought long and hard. Truly, this last wish tasked the very limits of my imagination, my beliefs, my ethics, my philosophy. Hours passed in silence, save for the gentle snoring of the ladies surrounding me.At last, I spoke. 'Genie, for my third wish, I want a big Blue head.' """

If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy!”The next morning, the American returned, placed his order, and then that evening he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, “These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday!”The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, “Si, senor.

Overwhelmed by the thought of spending the next ten years in this miserable place, he spends most of the day in bed staring at the ceiling.At 10 PM, the guards conducted roll-call, locked all the cells, and turned off the lights. Jim tried to sleep, but couldn't. Around midnight, he was snapped our of his thoughts when someone in the cellblock yelled ""TWELVE!"". Then, there was the sound of laughter reverberating around the building. He looked over to his cellmate who was laughing as well. Jim was surprised, but didn't make much of it. A little later, there was a shout of ""TWENTY NINE!""! Again, the inmates in the block started to hoot in delight. Jim was intrigued and asked his cellmate, who was doubled over laughing, just what the heck was going on with the numbers. ""Well..."", said Jim's cellmate, ""...those numbers aren't random, man. The people in this block have been in here a long time, so long in fact, that we all know each other's jokes by heart. We numbered them so that they're easier to tell! You can shout out a number, and every inmate in this building will know what joke you're talking about!""""You're pulling my leg!"", said Jim. The cellmate chuckles and says, ""No, I'm not, man! Look, I'll show you. Give me a number."" Jim shrugs, ""Fine... How about 85?"". The cellmate goes to the bars of the cell and yells out ""EIGHTY FIVE!"". The whole block starts to howl out laughing. The cellmate looks at Jim and smirks. Jim is astonished. ""Can I try?"", he asks. The cellmate beckons him to have at it. Jim gets off his bed and goes over to the bars of the cell. ""FIFTY THREE!"", he yells. No laughs, only silence. The cellmate says, ""Try again."" ""SIX!"", Jim yells. Still no response. ""What happened? Did I choose the wrong jokes?"" Jim's cellmate sighs, pats him on the back and says, ""It's not the jokes, buddy, you're just not telling them right."""

9164,"Three Scientists are studying how much a pig can eatThree scientists were interested in studying the stomach capacity of pigs. So they got a pig and fed it a lot of food. The only problem was, the pig would just start crapping after a while and they could never get an accurate measurement of how much food its stomach would hold. So one of the scientists got the brilliant idea to stick a cork in the pig's butthole to stop it from crapping. The pig ate. And it ate. And it ate. Once it was absolutely full, it stopped eating, the scientists wrote down how much food they fed it and the study was over.Now came the trouble of taking the cork out. For obvious reasons, the scientists didn't want to risk doing this personally, so they decided they would send in a trained monkey to do it. They set up the monkey and stood back. 1 scientist stood 50 yards away, 1 scientist stood 100 yards away, and 1 scientist stood 150 yards away. Then the monkey pulled the cork.Well, there was a huge spray of crap. The scientist at 150 yards got crap all over his shoes. He was furious and he walked up to the scientist at 100 yards, who had crap all over his shoes and pants.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn’t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn’t listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!"""

9302,"Two boys walk into a pet shop.There were two young boys in a pet shop. One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals—one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.First they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.“Hello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?” asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.The parrot looked at him, and to Derek's disappointment, the parrot said “Fuck off, I'm trying to sleep you dickhead!”They moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.Next was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.“There is little chance of it running away!” exclaimed Patrick, “we will never lose them!”The turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.“I hope it's the Bible!” said Derek, excitedly.But as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.Beside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. They searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn't recklessly rubbing the Lord's face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken—the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop's creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of “being a chicken,” in the Lord's eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.They sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.They said to the woman, “Can you help us?”She turned to them and replied, “Fuck off, I'm trying to sweep you dickhead.”Then she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.She said to the boys “I will help you. What is it that you need?”Derek asked of her, “Is there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?”And understanding the boys' woes she said to them, “Yes, there is one,” and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.“Here you will find the weevil.”And they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.But their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world's smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.They decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called “Fermented Bovine Urine” and the other would be “Greg” for these are the names that most please the Lord.The first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.Fermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.The next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.Fermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.The next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.“Surely” exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, “I can win this competition!”But whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.The next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.Greg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.The last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.Fermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger's Wikipedia page.It was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.The next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.As the owner of Greg, Patrick's experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?”But the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.The next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.Patrick's current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have I been cursed so?”But the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.A week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.Patrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. In his final moments he cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?”But though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.You see, my children, there is a moral here. You must always choose the lesser of two weevils."

The receptionist became irritated and said, 'You shouldn't come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that.''Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said. The Receptionist replied; 'Now you have caused some needless embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the Doctor in private.' The man replied, 'You should not ask people questions in a roomful of strangers if the answer could embarrass anyone.' The man then decided to walk out, waited several minutes and then re-entered. The Receptionist smiled smugly and asked, 'Yes??' 'There's something wrong with my ear,' he stated loudly.The Receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her advice. 'What is wrong with your ear, Sir?' 'I can't piss out of it,' he replied. The waiting room erupted in laughter"

The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of its mouth.The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a special imported ""Goony bird"" and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate, he exclaimed, ""Goony bird! The table!""Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, ""Goony bird! The shelf!""Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.""Wow!"" said the wife, ""If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing will!""

9428,"Paul has a shitty life...Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. The only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie.  Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.Artie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife.For Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  On Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  Two minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place.Halfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go.Artie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and ""Pays"" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling ""WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!"" ""WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?""...... on and on she yells until finishes with ""WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!"" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  The next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with ""yes, dear"", ""Of course, Dear"", ""I'll get right on it Dear."" All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie ""It's a go"".While Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her.  When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  Little does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.Artie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.The next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline ""Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway"""

The day was really quite beautiful, and the drink facilitated some deep thinking.My wife walked by and asked me what I was doing, and I said, ""nothing"". The reason I said ""nothing"" instead of saying ""just thinking"" is because she then would have asked, ""About what?"" At that point I would have had to explain that men are deep thinkers about various topics, which would lead to other questions.Finally I pondered an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts? Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?Well, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion. A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""I rest my case. Time for another beer, and then maybe a nap."

Thanks for coming through for me Mike.""When he lands in Europe, the first thing Dave does is pick up the phone and dial Mike to see how things are going.  Mike says, ""Hey, how ya doin?! ... Listen, I'm really sorry big brother, but the cat is dead.""Dave says, ""WHAT?! JESUS CHRIST, I'M NOT EVEN GONE FOR A DAY AND YOU JUST KILLED THE FUCKING CAT! THE WIFE AND KIDS LOVE THAT CAT! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?! You know the worst thing, Mike? You didn't even have the decency to let me enjoy my vacation for a single day.

9621,"The Nervous PriestA new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass, he asked the monsignor for suggestions to help him do better in the future. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."" So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door: 1. Sip the vodka, don't gulp. 2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. 3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. 4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C. 7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the spook. 8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the s**t out of him. 9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his a**. 10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T."" 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me"". 12. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, Yeah God. 13. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's."

9730,"A dead duckA woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out Of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, But as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, A dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" She cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."""

He says to himself "" I'm about 40 feet away, let's see what happens"". Then in a normal tone he asks ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" No responseSo the husband moves to closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" Still no response. Next he moves into the dinning room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks "" Honey, what's for dinner?"" Again he gets no response so.He walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away.

The townspeople gave him the gold in thanks.Thinking to treat himself a little, the Lone Ranger decided to give the gold to a blacksmith so he could melt it and make him spurs and a ranger badge. But the blacksmith was a bad guy, so he made the spurs and badge out of copper, painted them, and kept the gold for himself. When the Lone Ranger came to pick them up, he didn't check them much so he happily rode off with the copper spurs.""

One day Jack found out that he was a son of a noble landlord and inherited a fortune. He left the village and Jill for his estate. Jill felt sad and stopped going up the hill for water and instead chose to go to a lake nearby. Jack growing in the rich family turns into a douche and pretentious. One day he wanted to show his friend Jill that he was living well off without him. So he goes to Village invites Jill to come over to the city to visit him. So he shows Jill everything and taunts him how Jill cannot afford them. Later he goes to drop Jill in his Village. Jill then suggests they both should go to the well, just like their childhood. Jack agrees to that. They go to the well spend some time. After they start their journey back the well starts to speak. It says it was a wishing well all along and says it used to be happy every time they both used to come here and play. It says that wishing wells have a limit of wishes to give before they turn into a normal well. It offers the friends the last wish it has. Jack being a douche says to Jill ""I may not come to this bloody village again. I'll take the wish and will ask an iPhone for you for contacting me as it will take you a lifetime to buy one for yourself"". Jill gets hurt and as soon as Jack starts wishing Jill at the same time wishes ""I hope Jack disappears"" with tears in his eyes. Jill ends up with an iPhone7"

Whereas the party of the first part, who will be henceforth be addressed as 'the lawyers' and the party of the second part, henceforth addressed as 'the light bulb' do hereby agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (light bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:The party of the first part (lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light bulb) in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (light bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) to perform the customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part ('new light bulb'). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact actually becomes the party of the second part (light bulb).NB: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do so with the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as 'The Firm'."

No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.

Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work.

(1. A billion dollars) (2. Half my estate) (or 3. My daughters hand in marriage). No one however has the guts to do so and the party ends and everyone goes home.The very next year he throws another party's just like the first and at the very end he challenges someone to the same challenge as before. However no one has the guts the 2nd year either and everyone leaves.The third year comes and he decides to throw one more party, and at the end of the party he gives his challenge one more time. Just as he is finishing saying what he will give the lucky guy who can swim across, He hears a splash of someone jumping in.

10294,"A Daughter writes a letter to homeDear Mother and Dad:It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay.Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those headaches once a day.Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Dept. and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.Yes, mother and dad, I am pregnant. I know how very much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily.I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know that your oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told his father is an important gunbearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you there was no dormitory fire; I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture; I was not in the hospital; I am not pregnant; I am not engaged. I do not have syphillis, and there is no Negro in my life. However, I am getting a D in sociology and an F in science; and I wanted you to see these marks in proper perspective.Your loving daughter,"

10370,"Elephants never forgetOne day in 1981, a man by the name of Joseph Weston was hiking in Kenya after graduating from Tulsa Junior College.As he was hiking, he noticed an elephant in the distance that had its foot hovering in the air. Not wanting to startle the creature, Joseph slowly made his way toward the elephant. When he got close to the elephant, he noticed a large splinter of wood sticking out from the elephant's foot. Acting carefully, Joseph removed the splinter with his knife. After successfully removing it, the elephant looked at him and stomped its foot several times. Joseph stayed still, with the fear of imminent death. After stomping its foot, the elephant trumpeted loudly and walked away. Joe never forgot that day.Thirty years later, Joseph was with his family at the Tulsa Zoo when an elephant walked up to Joseph's side of the enclosure and stomped its foot several times. Remembering the incident from thirty years ago, Joseph couldn't help but wonder if this was the same elephant.Mustering all the courage he had, Joseph climbed over the fence and into the enclosure. He walked up to the elephant and held its gaze for several minutes before the elephant trumpeted. The elephant then wrapped its trunk around Joseph, picked him up, and then slammed him against the fence, killing him instantly.Probably wasn't the same elephant."

Tell them to join up quick before all of the places are filled.I was restless at first because you get to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m. But I am getting used to it, so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot, and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing.Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there’s warm water. Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food, plus yours, holds you until noon when you get fed again. It’s no wonder these city boys can’t walk much.We go on “route marches,” which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it’s not my place to tell him different. A “route march” is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.The sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don’t bother you none.This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don’t know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don’t move, and it ain’t shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don’t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain’t like fighting with that ole bull at home. I’m about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake . I only beat him once. He joined up the same time as me, but I’m only 5’6″ and 130 pounds and he’s 6’8″ and near 300 pounds dry.Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.Your loving daughter,Alice"

I built it with my own 2 hands. But do you think they call me Collin the housebuilder? No, they do not call me Collin the housebuilder.”A few seconds of silence follow before the farmer starts talking again.“ Do you see that church over there?”“Yes I do.”“You know who built that church?”“No, I...”“Well, I did, with my own 2 hands. And do you think they call me Collin the churchbuilder? Nooo, they don’t call me Collin the churchbuilder!”The man, feeling more and more uncomfortable and worried by the farmers talking, still stands still as if nailed to the ground but after a slightly longer period of silence, the farmer starts talking again.“Do you see that fence over there?”Before the man had the chance to even answer the question, the farmer poses another.“Do you know who built that fence? Well, that’s right, I did. With my own 2 hands! But do you think they call me Collin the fencebuilder? Noooo, they don’t call me Collin the fencebuilder!”The man unable to move and startled by the sudden anger of the farmer, stands there looking at the farmer and trying to make sense of this encounter when after a long silence the farmer finally says.“And I fucked that sheep only once!”"

10744,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.There once was a sorcerer’s apprentice, who had studied and toiled for many years in the service of his master, and was nearing the time when he should join the Brotherhood as a full member. So for his final project, his master set him this task: that he should destroy the city of Rome and scatter its inhabitants, by means of vegetation and foliage.This task sounded quite difficult to the apprentice, and he told his master so; after some thought, the master decided that using the power of a talisman would not be cheating, and he gave the apprentice permission to use one. The master rummaged around in his storage shed for a while, and came up with a piece of deep red crystal about the size of a fist, obviously broken from a larger stone. “This is the last remaining fragment of the ancient Sumerian Amulet of Distress, which was used centuries ago by the magicians of Persia to defeat their enemies. It should be more than adequate to your task.”The apprentice thanked his master and retired to his rooms to begin preparations for the project. He packed many magical ingredients and sorcerous components: newt’s eyes, dog’s tongues, elf teeth, the hair of homniculi, powdered unicorn horn, dragon scales,  everything he thought he might need. He also packed his grimoires and books, his manuals and advisories, instruments and implements, parchment, ink, quills, chalk, candles, vials, a cauldron. He put on a bracelet that would allow him to contact his master telepathically should the need arise. He wrote out his plans in detail, using secret writing and codes to hide the meaning from prying eyes. He loaded it all onto his donkey and began the long journey to Rome.But he forgot the talisman his master had given him. He forgot the last remaining fragment of the Sumerian Amulet of Distress. Unheeding of the danger, he set up camp near the Seven Hills and prepared his worksite. He started a fire, set up the cauldron and began filling it with ingredients. He chanted and sang. He gestured and danced. He used the entire force of his will and being toward the sole purpose of making the foliage and vegetation grow.And grow it did. Trees grew taller and bushier, and more menacing. Bushes spread and blocked the roads and highways. Weeds started to invade the aquaducts. Plants everywhere around Rome were growing out of control.Now, however, the apprentice reached the limit of his power. He had exhausted his own strength and had no more energy to exert. He collapsed in a heap by his campfire. He had overextended himself, used up his own life force in trying to keep the plants growing. He was dying now, and he touched the bracelet, reaching out to his master telepathically.“Master, what happened? I had everything ready, but the task was still too great. I have failed you and failed myself.”“My son, are you sure you had everything ready? Everything?”“Oh no … I forgot it and left it home … the Sumerian Distress Shard!”“Don’t leaf Rome without it.”"

And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg.  Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."" Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent. To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP). And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks. And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are."" And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""  ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com. Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). That is how it all began. And that's the truth."

10992,"What's the Moral of the story?Picture a tranquil pond and in this pond there’s a small fish swimming just under the water and he spots a fly hovering above the water and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches I would be able to jump up and get him. So the fish went about his business keeping an eye on the fly.A bear walking along the pond sees the fish eyeing the fly and thinks. If that fly drops 6 inches the fish will go for the fly and I can grab the fish. So the bear crouches behind a bush and waits.A little while later a hunter comes by the pond and sees the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would get the fly, the bear will go for the fish and I can get a clear shot on the bear. So the hunter sits down and starts to enjoy his lunch.A small field mouse wanders up and looks over the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would jump to get the fly and the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to take his shot so he could get the bear and I could run in and get a bit of his sandwich. And we would all be very happy.Just about that time a sneaky sly cat wanders on to the situation and thinks to himself if that fly were to drop just 6 inches then the fish would jump to get the fly and the bear would go for the fish, the hunter would drop his cheese sandwich to get his gun to shoot the bear and the mouse would run in and get a bit of his sandwich. And I would run in get the mouse and we would all be so very happy.A small time goes by and:The fly drops 6 inches the fish jumps out to get the fly. The bear goes for the fish. The hunter drops his cheese sandwich to get his gun. The mouse runs in to get a bit of the cheese sandwich.  As the cat runs in, BOOM the hunter takes his shot and in all of the commotion the cat loses his balance and falls in the pond.Do you know what the moral of the story is?Every time a fly drops 6 inches a pussy gets wet!"
